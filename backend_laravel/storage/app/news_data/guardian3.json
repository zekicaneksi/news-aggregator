<strong>Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation</strong> and its CEO, <strong>Chris Wallace</strong>,<strong> </strong>with the news not that promising for those in northern Australia hoping for some relief on soaring premiums.</p> <p>First, the Labor senator <strong>Nita Green </strong>asked about how much cyclone-related insurance premiums were expected to fall given the Morrison government had promised drops of as much as 58%.</p> <p>Well, as it turns out, the change of government meant Labor could get its mitts on the modelling and, lo and behold, the reductions in premiums were much less. Two cracks at getting a better fix in June and then October now points to much smaller reductions, ranging between 6% and 32%, so Wallace said.</p> <p>As Green stated, “people have had enough of being lied to or misled”, with a barb towards the previous government.</p> <p>We’ll have more on this soon, but it’s fair to say many locals are already seeing premiums climb, so there won’t be much benefit when it lands.</p> <p>And that won’t be until the end of next year for big insurers and the end of 2024 for smaller insurers – none of which have signed up so far, Wallace said.</p> <p>So, the bottom line – there may be relief but for many there are two cyclone seasons to get through. And a parliamentary inquiry later this month to hear more about troubles with the scheme.</p> <p>Stay tuned.</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T07:54:21.507Z\">at 7.54am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636b52cf8f082d3d26930c6b\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/luke-henriques-gomes\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T07:15:24.223Z\">7.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Ex-official concedes she failed to stop robodebt despite knowing it was unlawful, inquiry hears</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>A former senior official has conceded she failed to do anything to stop the robodebt scheme even though she knew it was unlawful, a royal commission has heard.</p> <p>Under questioning by the senior counsel assisting, <strong>Justin Greggery</strong>, the former Department of Social Services official <strong>Serena Wilson</strong> accepted that by 2017 she was fully aware welfare debts were being raised using a method called “income averaging”.</p> <p>She was also aware of 2014 advice from her department’s lawyers saying such a practice was likely unlawful.</p> <p>Greggery said as the deputy secretary of the department Wilson was in a position to do something but “took no steps to stop it”.</p> <p>He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>You had an opportunity to do something about it and you didn’t, disregarding the consequences to those who had been subjected to the unlawful scheme.</p> </blockquote> <p>He said <strong>Wilson had failed to act with “actual knowledge of the consequences of the raising of unlawful debts on a large scale”.</strong></p> <p>After a long pause, Wilson replied:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, I think you’re right.</p> </blockquote>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"c1d50e234c0272493bfaecda2905545d917b506c\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/c1d50e234c0272493bfaecda2905545d917b506c/193_103_1068_641/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Serena Wilson, a former deputy secretary at the Department of Social Services, appears before the robodebt royal commission\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Serena Wilson, a former deputy secretary at the Department of Social Services, appears before the robodebt royal commission.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Greggery said she was “duty bound” to provide “full and frank advice” but instead took steps to ensure the “continuation of what you then believed to be unlawful”.</p> <p>He said she had “breached the [Australian Public Service] code of conduct” by her “deliberate choice”.

The company has argued it could provide “additional firepower” this decade to fill capability gaps.</p> <p>At Senate estimates this afternoon, Defence confirmed the company had made an unsolicited proposal with three options: build the destroyers in Spain with some modules in Australia; build them in Spain but with the combat system integration largely done in Australia; and build them entirely in Australia.</p> <p>Defence has ordered analysts from <strong>Rand Corporation</strong> to do a “risk reduction study” on the proposal so the government can weigh up the idea. An official, <strong>Tony Dalton</strong>, said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It’s quite a complex unsolicited proposal … so we have taken some more time and have sought some external support to conduct that assessment of that proposal.</p> </blockquote> <p>The navy was first approached with the first unsolicited proposal in May.</p> <p>Dalton said the company had submitted a second unsolicited proposal within the past four weeks, which “added some more capability options to the three destroyers”.</p> <p>He said <strong>Navantia was also offering to build six small warships known as corvettes</strong>. To date, this second idea has not been sent to Rand for review.

Of course, the bill contains elements that weren’t part of Labor’s election policies – most notably the changes to expand multi-employer bargaining.</p> <p>Albanese draws authority from the jobs and skills summit for these. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Big business, small business, unions, economists all agree the current enterprise bargaining system is not working – not working for business, not working for workers, and therefore not working for our economy.</em></p> <p><em>[People are] voting with their feet, enterprise agreement takeup is at an all-time low. The system is not delivering productivity gains employers need and the wage rises workers deserve.</em></p> <p><em>It’s failing women worst of all – those industries with the most women have the least bargaining power and the lowest pay. Disability care, cleaners, early childhood educators, nurses ... They were the heroes of the pandemic. But they are more than that: they’re heroes every single day. They deserve more than our thanks – they deserve better support, better conditions and better pay.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>Albanese particularly thanked the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia for their “constructive contributions” to the debate - they’re the ones that gave in-principle support for multi-employer bargaining at the summit, while the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australian Industry Group and Business Council of Australia were opposed.</p> <p>Albanese said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Not everyone is happy with 100% of this legislation. Both business and union representatives say this isn’t exactly what they would want. To me that says we’ve got the balance right. That doesn’t mean we expect everyone to agree on every proposal.</em></p> </blockquote> <p>While unions have grumbled about some changes making strikes harder (compulsory conciliation, and arbitration of intractable disputes) - they are by and large very happy, as evidenced by the ACTU encouraging members to contact their senators and urge them to pass the bill.</p> <p>Albanese concluded by observing that it is “easy to say you support higher wages as a hypothetical proposition. The test is: what are you prepared to do?”</p> <p>Albanese said Australians deserved secure jobs and better pay.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Our position clear and so is our mandate.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T02:10:45.148Z\">at 2.10am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636b07d48f083f3e45283949\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T01:55:14.777Z\">1.55am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">Climate protesters target Warhol art in National Gallery of Australia</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In Canberra, more things are being thrown at art pieces to protest the climate crisis.</p> <p>Climate protesters have attempted to deface one of the <strong>National Gallery of Australia</strong>’s prized modern art pieces, <strong>Andy Warhol</strong>’s Campbell’s soup cans, AAP reports.</p> <p>Images released by the activists showed several blue scrawls across several of the cans, but it is understood the paintings themselves were under glass frames and not damaged.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"eda68ae01d7da29ae5606d60665e85caa9c7c252\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/eda68ae01d7da29ae5606d60665e85caa9c7c252/0_0_2048_1536/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies Support scrawl across Andy Warhol’s ‘Campbell’s Soup Cans’ at the National Gallery of Australia, ACT\" width=\"1000\" height=\"750\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies Supporter scrawl across Andy Warhol’s ‘Campbells’s Soup Cans’ at the National Gallery of Australia, ACT</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: supplied by Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>The <strong>Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies</strong> group said in a statement on Wednesday it wants the Australian government to end support for the oil, gas and coal industries.</p> <p>It said it was part of a global civil resistance network known as <strong>A22</strong>.</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Families are having to choose between medicine and food for their children while fossil fuel companies return record profits.

All the more important that we lift our protection against cyber-threats and lift our protection against scams and fraudsters. That’s why we made our announcement earlier in this week about following through on our election commitment to set up an anti-scam centre. The best protection is ensuring that the data doesn’t get stolen in the first place. </p> <p>If that fails, we want to ensure that consumers are protected. So establishing an anti-scam centre inside the ACCC will provide consumers with the information and the protection they need and enable us to move quickly if some of these cyber-breaches lead to frauds and theft and scams going on in our economy.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T01:04:20.300Z\">at 1.04am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636af9738f083f3e452838e7\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/daniel-hurst\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-09T00:51:27.003Z\">12.51am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Coalition will support changes to laws governing ex-ADF personnel to safeguard national secrets, opposition says</strong></p> <p>The Coalition has offered to support legal changes if required to safeguard Australia’s national secrets after the government announced a review of China’s alleged attempts to recruit former Australian defence force personnel.</p> <p>The opposition’s defence spokesperson, <strong>Andrew Hastie</strong>, has issued the following statement:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p><em>Reports that ex-Australian fighter pilots were approached by Chinese interests to provide military training to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are deeply concerning.</em></p> <p><em>Such conduct, if these allegations are verified, is highly improper and contrary to the Australian national interest.</em></p> <p><em><strong>Our national military secrets – including tactics, techniques and procedures for our elite fighter pilots – must be safeguarded by serving defence members and our veterans.

They’re told to just live with it, it’s just part of being a woman, when actually there are very serious issues that can be treated and we could do so much more for women with pelvic pain and endometriosis.</p> <p>So we have launched today the process to find 16 specific clinics right around Australia, who will provide very special services to women with pelvic pain, who may well have endometriosis. And if they do, they will be able to refer them on to specific services.</p> <p>We think that this will revolutionise care for women with endometriosis and we are really excited about it. In the hunt for the clinics, we will be taking into consideration things like geographical location – we know that women in rural and regional areas particularly have a great deal of trouble accessing services like this.</p> <p>We will make sure that clinics are able to scale up and provide care for extra patients coming from outside their area. We’ll make sure that they have an absolute commitment to upskilling their staff and providing special services around the area of endometriosis and pelvic pain. We’ll make sure that they are prepared to be culturally appropriate.</p> <p>So there’ll be a range of things that we will be looking at in this tender process for clinics to provide the service.<br><br>Also, from 1 November we are very pleased to say that women who are having difficulty conceiving will be able to, on the MBS, get an MRI. This will also be life-changing for a lot of women who have tried to conceive for many, many years and have not been able to do so.

Now, in relation to compensation: the incoming president of the Cop, minister Shoukry has made it clear and the agenda makes it clear, this is not about compensation. This is about development assistance, working with countries, facilitating cooperation. And we have a particular focus on the Pacific here.

Reith was deputy leader of the Liberal party in the Howard era and served as minister for industrial relations and defence among others. But while Liberal politicians paid tribute to his “conviction” style of politics, others have remembered his role in the notorious “children overboard” claims about asylum seekers during the 2001 election campaign and his fight against dock workers in 1998.</p> <p>Melissa Davey, our medical editor, <strong>has an exclusive story this morning</strong> about how the Victorian government sent Covid contact tracing data to the national crime authority <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/09/victorians-covid-contact-tracing-data-sent-to-authority-for-potential-use-by-palantir\">for potential use by the data mining firm Palantir</a>.

Meghan Quinn, secretary of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, told a hearing that officials from Morrison’s department asked their counterparts in the industry department to provide a briefing to the prime minister on the Pep-11 gas project in December 2021, because Morrison had designated himself the decision-maker. Asked whether then resources minister Keith Pitt had received the same briefing, Quinn said: “I don’t believe so.”</p> <p><strong>Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka will appear in court</strong> in Sydney today over the alleged sexual assault of a woman.

If you’re keen to keep up with what’s happening with the US mid-terms, follow along over here. Here’s some of what we learned locally today: In the wake of a ransomware group beginning to publish Medibank customer data on the dark web overnight, the AFP announced it would expand Operation Guardian – which was set up to protect the 10,000 Optus customers who had their personal information posted online earlier this year – to those Medibank customers exposed. Clare O’Neil, the minister for home affairs and cybersecurity, said the fallout from the Medibank data breach could last months. The environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, said Coles and Woolworths need to “step up” and explain how they will deal with recycling soft plastics in the wake of the collapse of Australia’s biggest soft plastics recycler, REDCycle. The federal government used question time as an opportunity to target the previous government’s decision-making on the botched robodebt scheme through discussion of the royal commission. Mark Dreyfus called the scheme “shameful” while the opposition called the government’s use of question time to talk about the scheme “a politicised witch-hunt”. Meanwhile, in the robodebt royal commission itself, a former senior official conceded she failed to do anything to stop the scheme even though she knew it was unlawful. Advocates for survivors of child sexual abuse have welcomed the government’s announcement of $15m in new funds to help deal with backlogs and delays in the national redress scheme. Three Coalition politicians met with a senior Iranian diplomat in Canberra to directly call for an end to “violence, human rights abuses and persecution of Iranian women, girls and protesters”. Climate protesters attempted to deface one of the National Gallery of Australia’s prized modern art pieces, Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans, to protest a lack of action to address the climate crisis. The publicly owned Future Fund is investing billions into major polluting companies, Senate estimates questioning revealed. And Ged Kearney, the assistant health minister, and Anne Ruston, the shadow health minister, have joined together for a bipartisan announcement of clinics for endometriosis and pelvic pain. Look after yourselves, mates, and we’ll be back with you bright and early tomorrow. Cyclone reinsurance pool lowers expected premium cuts and is yet to sign up an insurer Senate estimates has been hearing from the Australian Reinsurance Pool Corporation and its CEO, Chris Wallace, with the news not that promising for those in northern Australia hoping for some relief on soaring premiums. First, the Labor senator Nita Green asked about how much cyclone-related insurance premiums were expected to fall given the Morrison government had promised drops of as much as 58%. Well, as it turns out, the change of government meant Labor could get its mitts on the modelling and, lo and behold, the reductions in premiums were much less. Two cracks at getting a better fix in June and then October now points to much smaller reductions, ranging between 6% and 32%, so Wallace said. As Green stated, “people have had enough of being lied to or misled”, with a barb towards the previous government. We’ll have more on this soon, but it’s fair to say many locals are already seeing premiums climb, so there won’t be much benefit when it lands. And that won’t be until the end of next year for big insurers and the end of 2024 for smaller insurers – none of which have signed up so far, Wallace said. So, the bottom line – there may be relief but for many there are two cyclone seasons to get through. And a parliamentary inquiry later this month to hear more about troubles with the scheme. Stay tuned. A former senior official has conceded she failed to do anything to stop the robodebt scheme even though she knew it was unlawful, a royal commission has heard. Under questioning by the senior counsel assisting, Justin Greggery, the former Department of Social Services official Serena Wilson accepted that by 2017 she was fully aware welfare debts were being raised using a method called “income averaging”. She was also aware of 2014 advice from her department’s lawyers saying such a practice was likely unlawful. Greggery said as the deputy secretary of the department Wilson was in a position to do something but “took no steps to stop it”. He said: You had an opportunity to do something about it and you didn’t, disregarding the consequences to those who had been subjected to the unlawful scheme. He said Wilson had failed to act with “actual knowledge of the consequences of the raising of unlawful debts on a large scale”. After a long pause, Wilson replied: Yes, I think you’re right. Greggery said she was “duty bound” to provide “full and frank advice” but instead took steps to ensure the “continuation of what you then believed to be unlawful”. He said she had “breached the [Australian Public Service] code of conduct” by her “deliberate choice”. Wilson accepted this was the case. The inquiry continues. There are fears for two pilots involved in an aviation incident north of Brisbane after reports of a collision involving two light aircraft, AAP reports. Three Queensland Fire and Emergency Services crews responded to the incident at Kybong, north of Brisbane, at about 3pm on Wednesday. Two aircraft were found in a paddock, separated by a distance of about 400 metres, a QFES spokesman said. Crews had to make their way on foot for about 100 metres to gain access to the site. Emergency services have now left and Queensland police remain on scene. Inspector Brad Inskip is expected to hold a press conference with further details later in the day. Going to Cop27? Take home this snazzy gift bag. My colleague on the inequality round, Luke Henriques-Gomes, has been following the robodebt royal commission all week and live-tweeting as well as reporting on it.

Here’s today’s Afternoon Update – for all the news you missed and everything you want to catch up on, courtesy of Antoun Issa: Here’s a little teaser for our forthcoming video series on the Victorian state election later this month, from the queen of one-minute explainers, Matilda Boseley, and our excellent Victorian state reporters, Benita Kolovos and Adeshola Ore. Melbourne Luna Park’s ‘Mr Moon’ to get a facelift Just stepping away from politics for a brief moment to bring you the very important news, per AAP, that the giant face at the entrance to Luna Park Melbourne, “Mr Moon”, is having a facelift for the first time since 1999. The face with a gaping mouth, which has swallowed up visitors entering the park since 1912, is undergoing a restoration as part of the theme park’s 110th anniversary celebrations. Local Melbourne artist Mark Ogge is completing the work, which will be overseen by Bob Clutterbuck – the last person to paint Mr Moon. The face has been restored several times over the years, taking it from its original chicken wire, hessian, and cement form to the fibreglass model unveiled and last painted in 1999. Defence considering contract for three more navy ships Defence officials have confirmed the Australian government is considering a proposal from the Spanish company Navantia to build three more ships for the navy, with it now subject to a risk study. Navantia’s pitch to build three additional Hobart-class destroyers has previously been the subject of media reporting. The company has argued it could provide “additional firepower” this decade to fill capability gaps. At Senate estimates this afternoon, Defence confirmed the company had made an unsolicited proposal with three options: build the destroyers in Spain with some modules in Australia; build them in Spain but with the combat system integration largely done in Australia; and build them entirely in Australia. Defence has ordered analysts from Rand Corporation to do a “risk reduction study” on the proposal so the government can weigh up the idea. An official, Tony Dalton, said: It’s quite a complex unsolicited proposal … so we have taken some more time and have sought some external support to conduct that assessment of that proposal. The navy was first approached with the first unsolicited proposal in May. Dalton said the company had submitted a second unsolicited proposal within the past four weeks, which “added some more capability options to the three destroyers”. He said Navantia was also offering to build six small warships known as corvettes. To date, this second idea has not been sent to Rand for review. Navantia has also pitched this to the defence strategic review. Thunderstorm asthma risk in parts of Victoria tomorrow There’s a high risk of thunderstorm asthma tomorrow in Wimmera in Victoria, and moderate risk across the state’s west. Official says she failed to tell Scott Morrison scheme could be unlawful A former senior Department of Social Services official, who was given damning legal advice the robodebt scheme was unlawful, has told a royal commission she lacked the “courage” to speak up and was now “ashamed”. In dramatic hearings on Wednesday, the royal commission was told Serena Wilson, a former deputy secretary at DSS, was made aware of the legal advice in early 2015 when the scheme was being designed. But she said she failed to personally tell former prime minister Scott Morrison the plan could be unlawful as she was under the belief it had already been “killed”. Wilson then claimed she was unaware for about two years that the unlawful “income averaging” method was being used in the robodebt scheme, saying she had been given assurances by another official, Malisa Golightly, who has since died. Wilson said she finally realised the unlawful method was being used in the “latter part” of 2017, but she did not have the “courage” to tell anyone. She told the hearing: And now I’m ashamed. And in hindsight I could have spoken up. Read the full story here: The SES have issued an evacuation warning for the NSW town of Darlington Point on the Murrumbidgee River. Santos’s NSW gas project still has hurdles to clear The debate over how to bring down energy prices in Australia still has a ways to run. One element often overlooked is that getting new gas supply into the market could take years (and arguably make little difference to prices given eastern Australia has bolted itself to global prices). Anyway, Santos yesterday updated investors on a few things, including the timing of when its much-delayed Narrabri coal seam gas project might get up. In short, the company is not expecting to make a final investment decision until its 2023-24 year. The company also noted that the timing hinges on approvals for the gas pipeline and Indigenous land title claims. The project is supposed to deliver as much as 70 petajoules of gas a year for 20 years to local consumers during its first phase involving 850 wells in and around the Pilliga state forest in northern NSW. Those wells, by the way, will produce as much as 840,000 tonnes of crystallised salt over the project’s life that will need to find a new home (and is one of the conditions that the state’s Independent Planning Commission included in its approval of the project). Anyway, not every bird is in the hand right now. Advocates for survivors of child sexual abuse have welcomed the government’s announcement of $15m in new funds to help deal with backlogs and delays in the national redress scheme. Last week, a Guardian analysis of government data revealed a growing backlog of claims sitting before the commission. The analysis showed the volume of claims being received by the scheme had more than doubled to a rate of about 710 a month this year. The backlog of claims awaiting a decision has increased by 265% in the past two years. The social services minister Amanda Rishworth on Wednesday announced $15m to help to reduce delay and address the “significant increase in applications” received since the second half of last year. The Blue Knot Foundation said the extra investment was welcome and said it would help to deal with the added volume of claims – a trend it described as positive. Cathy Kezelman, the organisation’s president, said: Hopefully, this will mean that survivors – including many who have already waited decades – will receive a sensitive trauma-informed service in a timely manner. We’re pleased that from early 2023, this government will respond to the outstanding recommendations of the 2-year review, to provide for a more survivor-centric scheme. Many changes have already been made, and this additional investment will help support the implementation of a process in which the Scheme can more efficiently respond to applicants, better meeting their needs. Less waiting, minimising any additional trauma, and fair and equitable redress will respond to the objectives of the Royal Commission’s redress recommendations in the tenor in which they were handed down. Read the background to this story here: Army chief signals decision coming on troubled Taipan helicopters The chief of army, Lt Gen Simon Stuart, has renewed concerns about the MRH90 Taipan helicopter, while signalling the government is currently weighing up its options. The helicopters are used by the army – including to provide support to special operations – while the navy also relies on them for maritime support, but the Howard government-era acquisition has had a number of problems. The then defence minister Peter Dutton said late last year that Australia was likely to buy up to 40 Black Hawk helicopters from the US as an alternative to the Taipans. Stuart told Senate estimates today: As you’re aware and as a matter of public record, despite efforts by all stakeholders, the MRH system has not been able to deliver the expected rate of effort and is more expensive to operate than we can afford over time. Stuart said those problems had led Defence to develop options, which were “currently being considered by the government”. He said a decision had not yet been made on the UH-60 Black Hawk. The secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, was reluctant to give timing on a decision, although it sounded like one might be imminent. He said a decision would be “announced by the government when it is ready to do so”: A decision will be announced at a time of the government’s choosing. Indigenous voice referendum should happen ‘soon’, Uluru statement co-chair says Uluru Statement from the Heart co-chair Pat Anderson has urged the federal government to not waste “momentum” for the Indigenous voice to parliament, saying the referendum on the constitutional change should happen “soon”. Anderson joined Prof Megan Davis at the National Press Club on Wednesday, saying the potential referendum date she had most recently heard was October 2023. Anthony Albanese has said the vote will occur sometime in the 2023-24 financial year, but has not committed to an exact date. Anderson said she wanted to see movement begin soon: There is a fine line between getting everybody ready for a referendum and when it is time to go and there is definitely a time to go. We can’t leave this hanging around for too long otherwise it removes momentum. I’ve been around here long time working in the space and this is the best opportunity we have ever had, so it is time to go, soon. Anderson said she was concerned about losing momentum for the change, if the referendum was not held in the next year or so. They are moving as quickly as they can, there is a lot of work to do. We have to work out how we will educate the Australian population, there is a lot of to-ing and fro-ing but we need to get out there fairly soon. Anderson said there was still work to do on educating the public about the potential change, speaking up about misinformation. Davis said she believed there was strong support for the voice in some parts of the federal Coalition, but that there was “a lot to run” before the parliament considers the change. Defence officials praise US navy admiral for resigning from Australian post to avoid Aukus conflicts Defence officials say a retired US navy admiral, Kirkland Donald, acted “in an exemplary fashion” by resigning from an Australian government position to avoid any perception of a conflict of interest. At a Senate estimates committee hearing, Greens senators have been asking questions about a Washington Post report about several retired US admirals or former US navy civilian leaders who have taken on roles as paid advisers to the Australian government since 2015. Defence officials confirmed at the hearing that Donald served on the submarine advisory committee from December 2017. The Washington Post report said Donald also served, since 2020, as chairman of the board of Huntington Ingalls Industries, which makes Virginia-class submarines, which the Australian government is considering under the Aukus defence pact. Donald told the newspaper he resigned from the committee in April 2022 to avoid any conflicts after “it became evident” his committee “would need to become involved in providing independent critical assessment” on acquiring nuclear-powered subs. Tony Dalton, a deputy secretary at the Department of Defence, said the terms of reference for the submarine advisory committee were focused on the French attack class submarines (now abandoned) and the existing Collins class submarines. Those terms had not changed after the Aukus announcement in September 2021 but Donald had resigned “to avoid even the perspective of a conflict of interest”, the Senate committee was told. Dalton said Donald had managed the matter “in an exemplary fashion”. Plibersek says she has ‘consistently supported’ government on stage-three tax cuts The environment minister, Tanya Plibersek, has responded to claims by a constituent of hers that she had told him if it were up to her she would “get rid” of the stage-three tax cuts. Guardian Australia reported the comments last week, after Labor supporter Alex Richardson claimed she told him this on Saturday 29 October at a school fair. On Wednesday Plibersek told reporters in Canberra: Well I’ve consistently said I support the government position on that [stage-three tax cuts]. Asked if she denied her constituent’s account, Plibersek said: I’m not going to dignify your question with an answer. I’ve consistently said I support the government position. Question time ends Yeesh that was a long one, thanks for bearing with me! I have lots of updates to bring you from my intrepid colleagues, who have been chasing down all kinds of information this afternoon, so stick with us – today is far from done! Another opposition spitball (sorry, that’s just how they come across to me in the hectic, schoolroom dynamic of question rime) on power bills and the “broken promise” of $275 reduction in them, to the prime minister. It’s from the member for Braddon in Tasmania, Gavin Pearce, so Albanese spins off about Tasmania, eventually saying that there would be clean energy investment in the state over the next decade. Sort of. It was a bit hard to tell. Albanese dismisses question about the federal integrity commission and union officials There have been a couple of questions from the opposition today about why union officials are not covered by the national anti-corruption commission. They aren’t getting very far – Anthony Albanese answers this one, and says merely: Union officials, if they act corruptly in engagement with government agencies are treated like any other third party. And are covered. Dutton expresses agreement with Albanese on Iran Peter Dutton is called, and expresses accord with the PM’s statements on Iran: I join the Coalition with the comments of the prime minister. I recognise the work of the member for Menzies and other members in this house as well [who have] met with members of the community here and the outpouring of emotion is absolutely understandable. It seems the reporting is horrific and the treatment of women completely unacceptable. As a member for Menzies has pointed out at a number of discussions on this issue, there is heartfelt sentiment across the aisle in relation to this issue. The Coalition will support any actions the government takes even if it means an economic consequence for our country. There are markets otherwise that we can identify and we will work with the government to support you in decisions because a very clear, significant, tangible message needs to be said that this type of behaviour is abhorrent, unacceptable in any society and completely against the values our country. Albanese pressed on possible Iran sanctions There’s a question from Liberal MP Keith Wolahan about possible sanctions on Iran: Iranian Australians are pleading with us to follow the lead of the United Kingdom, Canada and the EU and impose sanctions against a regime which has violated the rights of Iranian women. Beyond the … condemnation, what action does the government intend to take? Anthony Albanese responds: I had as well as the foreign minister expressed my abhorrence at the actions of the Iranian regime in clamping down on the rights of women, in particular to wear whatever they want after the tragic killing of a woman. We have seen a clampdown on women in particular in Iran. The Labor government will continue to work with our allies including in multilateral forums such as the United Nations. I expect that this may well be a topic that is also raised at the meetings that I will be attending of global leaders over the coming week. I thank the member for his question. I acknowledge the enormous hurt that Iranian people and Iranian women in particular are feeling at this very difficult time. Watching this clampdown on human rights in Iran for things that were this country take the granted. We actually don’t have a vast number of economic relations between Australia and Iran. … We will continue to speak out, we will continue to vote in the forums in which Australia has a presence, to ensure that the people of Iran who are showing great courage, showing great courage in standing up for the Human Rights Commission, know that Australia, as always and in a bipartisan way, Australia is friends of all those who stand up for their individual rights and in this case, in particular the rights of women. Giles promises to honour Albanese government’s commitment on visas Independent Andrew Wilkie now, who refers to Labor’s promise to abolish temporary protection visas, enterprise visas and (I think, the transcription is a bit fuzzy) to fast track the refugee process. The minister for immigration, Andrew Giles, responds: I acknowledge [Wilkie] and many members of the crossbench have raised this issue with me in respect of this very significant event. I’m very proud to be a member of a government that recognises that we could be resolute in maintaining strong and secure borders while not abandoning our humanity. And this government made a commitment, as the member for Clark recognises, to transition people who … are owed our protection and on temporary protection visas to shift to permanent visas. That is a commitment we made and that I am working towards. We are doing so …. consultatively and deliberately. Making sure that we get this right. I welcome any further discussions with the member Clark, never the crossbench or members opposite on how we will meet this important commitment. There’s a question about housing which I missed, I’m sorry, but Jim Chalmers talks at length in response about the housing accord and how “people are coming from everywhere to be part of this”. Fletcher and Albanese trade barbs on energy prices On to energy prices now. The prime minister is asked by Paul Fletcher: You promised Australian households and businesses you would cut their power bills by $275 a year - have you apologised to Australians for your broken promise, one you have refused to repeat since the election? Anthony Albanese responds by talking about power prices prior to the election and how high they were. He’s told to come back to the question but he doesn’t really come back to the question. He does throw in a barb about Angus “great job” Taylor though: It is no wonder the only person who has ever said ‘great job, Angus’, is the shadow treasurer who was responsible for this debacle! Another dixer on robodebt to the attorney general Mark Dreyfus – we are going to keep getting these until the end of question time – but Paul Fletcher, manager for opposition business, complains again on the same point of order as previously, essentially trying to gag discussion of the royal commission, saying “this exercise is nothing but a politicised witch-hunt”. He’s cautioned for those comments, and eventually the question is ruled in order, and Dreyfus continues his comments: It is shameful, our government believes in the rule of law, the former government took a cowboy approach to the legality of their actions, even with some thing as far-reaching as robodebt which ended up affecting 400,000 Australians. How could this happen? Who was responsible? What advice did they seek, what advice with a given and most important how can we make sure this never happens again? A royal commission will answer these questions and I have every confidence that this royal commission will. Defence minister plays straight bat to strange Bob Katter question on war and guns Bob Katter has asked a question – of sorts – about how many machine guns Australia has in its arsenal, and how many people won’t fight if there’s a war, and whether he can give the minister for defence the telephone number for “my Kalkadoon mob” who “held the British invasion at bay for years”. Look, I’m not really sure what to tell you about this. Anyway Richard Marles gets up and talks about the Albanese government’s defence strategy more broadly. Clearly, we’re going to need to think in strategic terms in the future much more in terms of impactful projection. Being able to hold our adversaries at risk at far greater distances from our shores, both in terms of greater lethality as the member has alluded to, but also through the full spectrum of proportionate response. Exactly how we do that will be the work of the defence strategic review. Shorten says young people disproportionately hurt by robodebt Back to Shorten again, who was thrown another dixer about robodebt, this time about why the royal commission is important to young Australians. He also tells an anecdote about a young Australian who received a debt. For brevity, I’m not going to add the anecdotes in; they are as awful and heartbreaking as any of the stories of robodebt recipients we’ve heard over the past two weeks and the years we’ve been covering this. But here are some of Shorten’s interspersing comments: Young Australians were a disproportionate share of the unlawful robodebt scheme. Almost half or about 195,000 of the victims of the robodebt scheme were aged under 30. In fact, 79,000 were 24 and under. Some were just kids, aged 17. Australians deserve and need to know why an Australian government continued to run an unlawful scheme that raised hundreds of thousands of unlawful debts against innocent Australians when they must have known it was illegal. The opposition members down the other end taunt at question time that we’re not going to find what they think we are looking for. Colleagues in this house, we already know it was unlawful … it was stupid, it was wrong. It was just wrong. But what we don’t know is why did the ministers who would the ministers keep doing it for 4.5 years? No smirks excuse the responsibility of not doing a job properly to money and hundreds of thousands of young Australians. ‘Human services stripped of humanity’: Albanese says robodebt victims owed the truth A second dixer on Robodebt, this time for the prime minister. Anthony Albanese starts by summarising the “trauma and fear in the name of the Australian government”, before telling the story of Tony, who got a debt notice when he had been going through cancer treatment at the time he received benefits. At the height of the scheme, the member for Aston, who was human services minister, said this: “We will find you, we will track you down and you will have to repay those debts, and you may end up in prison.” What we know is that at the very time, at the very time the government knew that it was illegal and unlawful in black and white. Human services stripped of humanity. Social services without social conscience. We are, through the robodebt royal commission, trying to get to the bottom, to make sure that it can never happen again. We do need to have answers to this. The robodebt royal commission playing a critical role in exposing the events that led to such trauma for hundreds of thousands of Australians. And we owe it to them, including those who are not around any more … to get to the bottom of these facts. Shorten takes aim at Morrison over robodebt Shorten continues on Robodebt: [The former prime minister] continued: “at the end of the day … ministers, I and my colleagues have to look constituents and I look them in the eye and be responsible for these decisions.” Then he shared that memorable farmyard anecdote: “when I play rugby [my coach] described the bacon and eggs principle: the chicken is involved but the pig is committed to the task.” He further explained his analogy: “under our system of government it must be ministers who set the policy direction, he added it is important not only to establish clear lines of accountability it is fundamental for our democracy to keep faith with the Australian people.” The member for Cook and ministers responsible for the unlawful operation of the robodebt scheme, we don’t know if they will be called to give evidence to the royal commission but we do know this – applying his former principles, they cannot simply pass the buck onto the public service for their almost five years illegal, unlawful shakedown of hundreds of thousands of Australia’s most vulnerable citizens. I tabled the former prime minister’s speech about ministerial responsibility government policy. Thank you. There’s a question about the royal commission into robodebt, and the opposition is objecting to the matter being discussed in the House at all. This is overruled by the speaker and discussion of the matter is allowed. The question was: “What have we learned about who was responsible for the unlawful robodebt scheme?” Bill Shorten stands to speak: In just under two weeks appearing in to the royal commission to robodebt we have learned several facts. One, the previous government received departmental and external legal advice that robodebt was unlawful. From its own staff. We have also learned a top tier law form provided the good advice to the former government that the scheme was not able to be justified, prompting internal emails noting this particular draft was catastrophic. We have also learned the former director of payments integrity at the Department of Social Services and his team saw the income averaging of robodebt as unethical, from the beginning, and that the initial legal advice warning this was unlawful was black and white. That should have been the end of the proposal but as to who was responsible for the unlawful robodebt scheme, I draw the attention of the House to a speech concerning the demarcation between ministerial responsibility in the public service given by the former prime minister on 19 August 2019, at the Institute of Public Administration, outlining his key six guideposts outlining his approach and government. He then said responsibility for setting policy, for making calls and decisions lies with the elected representatives. Plibersek urges industry to ‘do its share’ on recycling after collapse of REDcycle scheme Kylea Tink, the independent MP for North Sydney, is asking about the collapse of the REDcycle scheme to environment minister Tanya Plibersek. She’s asked to outline the specific steps she will take to ensure the recycling industry delivers for Australians. Plibersek responds: I was very disappointed as the member for North Sydney to hear REDcycle has closed its doors, and I have spoken to Coles and Woolworths today, the food and grocery council, to see what we will do in the immediate future. And then longer term. Immediately, we see tons of soft plastics that have been stockpiled. We have to deal with that stockpiled first and longer term we have to invest in new infrastructure that will recycle the plastic. This government is already playing a role with environment ministers around the country, we have upped our ambition, we’ve given $1m to the Australian Food and Grocery council to work with industry to develop more sustainable use for these plastics, we have set aside $60m for recycling plastics specifically, we are working across Australia to phase out single-use plastics, bags, plates, cups, stirrers, plastic cutlery. I will tell you this, families are committed to action, this government is committed to action, it’s important industry also does its share. Opposition presses government on rising mortgage repayments Moving along to the cost of living. The opposition is clearly going at the government on mortgages today. The question from Angus Taylor is to the treasurer: An average family is $2,000 worse off under this budget with their mortgage going up by more than $1,000 since March. [Doesn’t] this family expect the government to deliver on its promise of cheaper mortgages? Jim Chalmers starts with some sledges to the opposition: Two weeks and one day since the budget was headed down, and the shadow treasurer had now asked his second question about anything to do with the budget. I welcome the question, I welcome his interest even if it is belated and typically incompetent and misunderstood. The substance to his answer comes later, such as it is, and it is basically just pointing to the “help to buy” policy – again. O’Neil urges social media companies to crack down on Medibank data being shared Clare O’Neil also issues a warning to social media and traditional media companies not to publish or share stolen Medibank data: The eSafety commissioner has been included in the national coordination mechanism because social media companies and indeed traditional media companies are going to be crucial in our national response to this problem. And I say now, I know I do not need to point out the importance of social media companies not allowing this information to be published and not allowing it to be shared on your platforms and to traditional media companies, to not rubbish the private information of Australians. If you do so, you will be aiding and abetting the scumbags were at the heart of these criminal acts and I know you would not do that your own country and its citizens. Clare O’Neil, the minister for home affairs and cyber security, is speaking now about the Medibank data breach. She says a relatively small number of people whose medical data is currently compromised is likely to grow, and this will be a long game, unfortunately: The parliament would be aware that last night data that was expelled traded during the Medibank attack was released on a dark web. Based on information that we have at this moment, the number of citizens whose medical information may have been compromised is small at this stage. But I want the Australian people to understand that that is likely to change and we are going through a difficult period now that may last for weeks, possibly months, not days and hours. I cannot articulate the disgust I have for the scumbags who are at the heart of this criminal act. People are entitled to keep their health information private, even amongst adds aware attackers, the idea of releasing personal medical information of other people is considered beyond the pale. So make no mistake about it, this is not just any ordinary group of study criminals, this is the lowest of the low. I would Australians know that your government stands with you, the prime minister said this morning that he is a Medibank customer like millions of other Australians, I am too. Here’s Albanese’s answer on Labor’s housing scheme: At the 2022 campaign launch, we had as one of the centrepieces that launch our help to buy scheme. That was based upon the very successful scheme that has been implemented for many years in Western Australia. There are also schemes being looked at in New South Wales by the Liberal government and in Victoria, of course, are being implemented as well. This is a good policy and it was in the budget, in the budget, our help to buy scheme. Peter Dutton asks Anthony Albanese about Labor’s ‘plans for mortgages’ Dutton: In Labor’s 2022 campaign launch, they claimed that Labor has a real plans for mortgages. Can the prime minister provide a straight answer, did he make this statement, yes or no? There’s a bit of back and forth before Anthony Albanese gets to his feet. He starts by going on about the campaign and how successful it was, before the speaker interjects and calls for order: I am trying to hear the prime minister but there is continual interjecting on my left which makes it very difficult, I’m looking at you, leader of the Nationals. There are repeated calls for order before Albanese starts speaking again. Thanks so much Caitlin Cassidy! We’re going to jump straight into question time. All good things must come to an end, including my time on the blog. The spectacular Stephanie Convery will be with you for the rest of the afternoon. The Nationals senator Susan McDonald is asking treasury officials about what modelling it has done on potential changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, known as the PRRT. Marty Robinson from Treasury’s tax division said the department had begun looking at the PRRT regime, including the transfer pricing arrangements for vertically integrated projects, and the tolling arrangements which relate to pricing arrangements for gas between upstream extraction and downstream processing. McDonald also asked if work was being done on a potential super profit tax for the resources sector, and it sounds like a yes. Robinson: The government has been tasking us with looking at a range of options around responding to the energy price issue, and as I mentioned before the Treasurer has made it pretty clear that no option is being ruled out. Finance minister Katy Gallagher said a secretaries group between departments was working collaboratively on options to put to government to consider how to respond to the energy crisis. She said it was “not just about tax”, and other measures were also on the table. When asked how much tax it could levy from the sector, Robinson said it would depend on the final design of the measures. Treasury’s Diane Brown said “comprehensive” work was underway, including changes to the regulatory and tax system, and they would be costed once parameters were decided upon. Gallagher said it was a “highly unusual” environment and the government was focused on easing energy prices where possible. She said that once a decision was taken, then information about the cost would be made public. McDonald asked if changing the PRRT would have the effect of lowering electricity prices. “No options are being ruled out at this stage, the resources tax, the PRRT, hasn’t usually been used in that way, but we are not ruling anything out at this stage.” McDonald questions whether changes to the depreciation schedule to the PRRT were on the table, Robinson says he is not aware that is under consideration. Three Coalition politicians have met with a senior Iranian diplomat in Canberra to directly call for an end to “violence, human rights abuses, and persecution of Iranian women, girls and protestors”. The shadow minister for foreign affairs, Simon Birmingham, met with Iran’s chargé d’affaires yesterday. Birmingham was joined by the shadow assistant minister for foreign affairs, Claire Chandler, and the MP for Menzies, Keith Wolahan. The Guardian reported this morning that the Iranian leadership was resisting growing demands from clerics and some reformist politicians to stage a new referendum on Iran’s constitution as hardline parliamentarians insist the only response to the recent unrest sweeping the country is for violent protesters to be executed. Birmingham, Chandler and Wolahan said they took the opportunity to register concerns about “the latest human rights violations against women, girls and protesters in Iran, sparked by the killing of Mahsa Amini”. In an open letter to the Iranian community in Australia, they wrote: This week, at our instigation, we met with the representatives of the Iranian Embassy in Australia. We directly condemned, in the strongest possible terms, the Iranian Government’s actions. We made clear our disgust and directly conveyed the concerns of the Iranian community in Australia. We called on the Iranian Government to immediately cease violence, human rights abuses, and persecution of Iranian women, girls and protestors. We urged Iran not to undertake threatened mass executions of protestors. We also expressed deep concerns at the Iranian Government’s control of communication within Iran, while calling on them to allow independent investigations of human rights abuses, and hold to account those responsible. The Coalition is calling on the Albanese government to “announce a tangible response to the human rights abuses in Iran and make its position clear on the implementation of diplomatic measures which have been proposed by the community and, in many cases, have already been implemented by our allies and partners around the world”. The foreign affairs minister, Penny Wong, has previously condemned the deadly and disproportionate use of force against protesters in Iran and has called on the authorities to allow peaceful rallies and to cease the oppression of women. The Greens have announced they will be preferencing Labor above the Liberals in all seats at the upcoming Victorian election. Victorian Greens leader Samantha Ratnam says the party is not working with the Liberals. This is despite reports in the Australian today that the Liberals are considering preferencing the Greens above Labor in seats like Richmond and Northcote in an effort to oust Labor MPs. Here’s what Ratnam said: The Greens will be recommending preferences to Labor ahead of the Liberals in every seat in Victoria. If Labor is serious about a progressive parliament, they must commit to preferencing the Greens and progressive independents ahead of the Liberals across the state. What the Liberals do is up to the Liberals. We have not met with them and there is no Greens-Liberal deal. We’ll direct preferences to Labor and progressive parties across the state, and we’re calling on Labor to do the same. Ratnam has also called on all parties running in the election to put the far-right and religious right last in their preferences before early voting begins on Monday. This includes One Nation, the United Australia party, Freedom party, Family First and the Democratic Labour party. Ratnam says: Parties like One Nation, United Australia Party and Freedom Party are anathema to the vast majority of Victorians. The Greens-initiated inquiry into the far right earlier this year exposed how their conspiracy-driven Trumpian politics is a danger to our political system. Family First and DLP are running on explicitly transphobic and homophobic campaigns and their politics of hate has no place in the Victorian Parliament. The failure of Labor to reform the corrupt group voting ticket system means a party can get elected into parliament on as little as 0.5% of the vote. To keep these hateful parties out of our parliament they need to be put last on everyone else’s group voting tickets this year. Professor Megan Davis and Pat Anderson AO are taking questions at the National Press Club. To recap, they are accepting the 2021 Sydney Peace Prize for the Uluru Statement from the Heart. On the timing of the referendum, Anderson says the latest she’s heard is October 2023, but there’s a “fine line between getting everybody ready” and losing momentum. I’ve been around here for a long time working in the space and this is the best opportunity we have ever had so it is time to go … you have to inform yourselves, doesn’t matter which way you vote, do it with some conscience, with some heart and with some intellect … there comes a time when you are at the ballot box and it is just you and your conscience. Get yourself ready for that time in your life because [for] all of us over 18 this is probably one of the biggest things we are ever going to do. Anderson then has a little dig at the journalists in the room, who will clearly have a very significant role throughout the referendum process. We do respect you but you’ve got to do your job a bit harder .. the press has an important job to do here and … sometimes the stories are one-sided. Often it is clear the journalist does not have a good history background. You need to be a little more agile and a bit more energetic about getting to the truth of issues. There is a responsibility there for the journalist to do the best they can and to rise to this occasion. Because I think this is only going to happen in our lifetime. I hope it happens this time because I won’t be around. We don’t want to leave it to our grandchildren. Because we are not going away. Believe me. The Nationals senator Susan McDonald is asking treasury officials about what modelling it has done on potential changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, known as the PRRT. Marty Robinson from Treasury’s tax division said the department had begun looking at the PRRT regime, including the transfer pricing element for gas between upstream extraction and downstream processing. McDonald also asked if work was being done on a potential windfall profit tax for the resources sector, and it sounds like a yes. The government has been tasking us with looking at a range of options around responding to the energy price issue, and as I mentioned before the Treasurer has made it pretty clear that no option is being ruled out. Finance minister Katy Gallagher said a secretaries group between departments was working collaboratively on options to put to government to consider how to respond to the energy crisis. She said it was “not just about tax”, and other measures were also on the table.

McDonald questions whether changes to the depreciation schedule to the PRRT were on the table, Robinson says he is not aware that is under consideration. Katy Gallagher says energy market ‘is not working’ and government must intervene Amid questioning about what the government intends to do in the gas and electricity sector, the finance minister Katy Gallagher said the government would prefer not to intervene but was being forced to act. “It is having really significant impacts on manufacturers, on big business, on small business, and they are saying to us they won’t be able to keep operating,” she told the Senate economics committee. This is the reality, this is the real world. It is unsurprising that companies would prefer the government doesn’t get involved ... but we are living in pretty extraordinary times and the government has to make decisions across the economy. At the moment the market is not working and it is causing distorted outcomes ... and it is absolutely appropriate that the government is at the table trying to work out what to do about this. Treasury’s Diane Brown confirmed that the department would look at the impact on future investment as part of the “comprehensive” advice it would provide to the government. The Indigenous activist and human rights lawyer Prof Megan Davis says Aboriginal people don’t want to be used as “a political football” anymore. The Uluru Statement from the Heart was released as an invitation five years ago. Davis says since then she vividly remembers the morning after the 2019 federal election, when elders from the dialogues called to say – “take me off your list … my heart cannot take this”. Concluding her address to the National Press Club, Davis says she’s “not a Pollyanna” by any means, but it is crucial to believe that Australia can, and will, change. We won in 1967 and we can do it again. On election night, the prime minister promised to implement the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. And that night our hearts were full. Much has been made of the prime minister’s speech at Garma when he released a draft form of words for the nation to discuss and give input into. It is not set in stone, but it is a good beginning. The process should not be used to hollow out the meaning and the intent which we sometimes see in commentary of political pundits. The political reality is that Australians won’t accept change in the constitution unless they can be sure that the change is worth making. And that they can be confident about its impact. Despite everything, we responded with a statement of love … you must suspend your disbelief that this country cannot change. Against all the evidence, you must imagine that this country can be better. Imagine that this nation can change. She reads the statement in full. Voice to parliament is ‘aimed at enhancing the participation of Indigenous peoples’ in state decisions: Megan Davis Back to the National Press Club, where Prof Megan Davis is addressing the room on the Uluru Statement from the Heart. She turns to calls by some First Nations people including Greens Senator Lidia Thorpe for a treaty prior to the implementation of a voice to parliament. She says the sequencing was discussed quite deliberately at the dialogues. I know this has been the subject of some debate; the sequencing was the subject of very diligent consideration in all the dialogues that led to Uluru. During the dialogues, delegates engaged in very comprehensive discussion of the political and legal reasoning and logic of the ‘voice first, treaty second’ sequencing, but the opportunity on the table for us in 2017 was constitutional recognition and treaty is not constitutional. She says the commitment to a referendum is being discussed without “any real discussion and understanding of the need and exigency of the body”. There is an … understandable impatience for detail on voice, but very little scrutiny on why it is needed or why people want a voice. Discussion is divorced from policy settings that plague our people’s lives on the ground and subjugate our voice to the bureaucracy … it is why the reform proposed will provide an upfront political empowerment. It is tactile, it is pragmatic, it empowers our people. The outcome captured in the Uluru Statement from the Heart was a testament to the efficacy of a structured process that produced a historic consensus, coalescing around a constitutional mechanism that compels the state to listen to our voice … It is aimed at enhancing the participation of Indigenous peoples … in the decision-making of the state … because it’s communities themselves that know better than anyone else, what communities need. Peter Dutton meets with Chinese ambassador to Australia The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has met with the Chinese ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian. Dutton said yesterday’s meeting at Parliament House was “constructive” and they had “discussed security, trade and human rights issues”. He wrote on Twitter that he would “continue to engage in an open and honest dialogue in matters relating to the safety, security and prosperity of our region”. Dutton, a former defence minister, has been one of the Coalition’s most outspoken members on the security threats posed by China and he said during the election campaign he had “no doubt” the Chinese Communist party wanted the Morrison government to lose. Dutton was criticised by the Chinese government in November last year when he said it would be “inconceivable” that Australia would not join US-led military action to defend Taiwan in the event Beijing launched military action against the self-governed democracy. Earlier today, the Chinese embassy in Canberra posted a photo of the meeting with Dutton and said the two sides exchanged views on bilateral, regional and international issues. The embassy said Xiao had argued this year’s 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations were a chance to get the relationship back on the “right track” based on mutual respect. PM says secure jobs, better pay bill strikes balance between union and business demands The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has spoken in the House of Representatives debate on Labor’s secure jobs, better pay bill. Albanese said that Australians voted for measures including putting job security into the Fair Work Act as an objective, and changes to boost gender pay equity. Of course, the bill contains elements that weren’t part of Labor’s election policies – most notably the changes to expand multi-employer bargaining. Albanese draws authority from the jobs and skills summit for these. He said: Big business, small business, unions, economists all agree the current enterprise bargaining system is not working – not working for business, not working for workers, and therefore not working for our economy. [People are] voting with their feet, enterprise agreement takeup is at an all-time low. The system is not delivering productivity gains employers need and the wage rises workers deserve. It’s failing women worst of all – those industries with the most women have the least bargaining power and the lowest pay. Disability care, cleaners, early childhood educators, nurses ... They were the heroes of the pandemic. But they are more than that: they’re heroes every single day. They deserve more than our thanks – they deserve better support, better conditions and better pay. Albanese particularly thanked the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia for their “constructive contributions” to the debate - they’re the ones that gave in-principle support for multi-employer bargaining at the summit, while the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Australian Industry Group and Business Council of Australia were opposed. Albanese said: Not everyone is happy with 100% of this legislation. Both business and union representatives say this isn’t exactly what they would want. To me that says we’ve got the balance right. That doesn’t mean we expect everyone to agree on every proposal. While unions have grumbled about some changes making strikes harder (compulsory conciliation, and arbitration of intractable disputes) - they are by and large very happy, as evidenced by the ACTU encouraging members to contact their senators and urge them to pass the bill. Albanese concluded by observing that it is “easy to say you support higher wages as a hypothetical proposition. The test is: what are you prepared to do?” Albanese said Australians deserved secure jobs and better pay. Our position clear and so is our mandate. In Canberra, more things are being thrown at art pieces to protest the climate crisis. Climate protesters have attempted to deface one of the National Gallery of Australia’s prized modern art pieces, Andy Warhol’s Campbell’s soup cans, AAP reports. Images released by the activists showed several blue scrawls across several of the cans, but it is understood the paintings themselves were under glass frames and not damaged. The Stop Fossil Fuel Subsidies group said in a statement on Wednesday it wants the Australian government to end support for the oil, gas and coal industries. It said it was part of a global civil resistance network known as A22. Families are having to choose between medicine and food for their children while fossil fuel companies return record profits. And yet our government gives $22,000 a minute in subsidies to the fossil fuel industry. The gallery is cooperating with the Australian federal police. Voice to parliament would constitute substantive recognition of First Nations Australians: Megan Davis Davis turns to the word “recognition” – one which has been thrown around a lot as of late. It’s a word that has been used, Davis says, on a spectrum from mere tokenism, as we have seen in our politics, to concrete, nation-altering change – what First Nations people are working towards. Recognition is a complex legal and political concept. Its dictionary meaning does mean acknowledgment but it can mean many things in a legal and political context. It can mean symbolic acknowledgment. It can mean a preamble. But it also means substantive change, substantive reform, to power relations. It’s on a recognitions spectrum. At one end of that spectrum is what we call weak recognition … it does not compel the state to do anything. It doesn’t stop or prohibit the state from doing something. It is rather a statement of fact. It is symbolic. At the other end of the spectrum, which is really where First Nations reside, is concrete or substantive recognition. There is many mechanisms that recognise substantive recognition. It can be something like this parliament. It could be something like a designated parliamentary seat. It can be treaty, it can be a voice to parliament. The problem in 2015 was the public discussion in Australia rarely rose above the dictionary meaning of recognition, which is acknowledgment. Australia historically provided ‘minimalism and symbolism’, not substantive change, on Indigenous matters: Prof Megan Davis Davis says she will use the address to speak about the process of the First Nations regional dialogue, which is vital to convey to the Australian people how important and generous the Uluru Statement from the Heart is. The First Nations regional dialogue was conducted under the auspices of the referendum council … the first of its kind since the Australian constitutional order commenced in 1901. Many Australians would know that First Nations were excluded from the drafting of the Australian constitution … therefore, this process, the dialogue process, was unprecedented in our nation’s history. Davis says the dialogue was the first time a constitutional convention had been convened with, and for, First Nations people – a profound response to “the historical exclusion of our people from Australia’s constitutional system”. She says historically, Australian politics has provided “minimalism and symbolism” when it comes to Indigenous matters. The Uluru Statement from the Heart and the dialogue process universally rejected symbolism as an acceptable form of constitutional recognition alone … there is an alignment between non-Indigenous Australians and First Nations peoples in terms of their desire [is] that this reform is not tokenistic, that this reform is not symbolic, but that it must be substantive, it must change people’s lives on the ground, otherwise why go to a referendum? Meanwhile at the National Press Club this afternoon, Prof Megan Davis and Pat Anderson AO, architects of the Uluru Statement from the Heart, are holding an address on the lands of the Ngunnawal and Ngambri people. Davis and Anderson are two of the three First Nations leaders accepting the 2021 Sydney Peace Prize for the historic Uluru Statement. Davis acknowledges the presence of First Nations in the room who were present at the 2016 and 2017 regional dialogue, including the women who have pushed the movement forward for five years. The Uluru Statement from the Heart is a shared endeavour of many minds and many hands. To that end, I want to begin by acknowledging the presence here today of some of the men and women of the First Nations regional dialogue … I also note the Aboriginal women in attendance. The quiet work in advocacy of women has sustained this movement for change since the Uluru Statement was issued to the Australian people five years ago. It has been led by women, and we are really honoured that a woman – minister Linda Burney – will take that forward. The publicly owned Future Fund is investing billions into major polluting companies, Senate estimates questioning has revealed. Answers to questions on notice to the Greens senator Barbara Pocock found the fund is investing a total of $3.4bn into the top 50 fossil fuel emitting companies in the world. Pocock said there was a deep irony in the government relying on dividends from polluters to pay for infrastructure to deal with the damage the same companies were causing by investing in fossil fuels. The federal government’s Disaster Ready bill, currently before the Senate, will use proceeds from the Future Fund to pay for infrastructure to mitigate climate damage. Pocock: The Future Fund is invested in companies that have absolutely no intention to diversify away from coal and gas, with $549m directly invested in Woodside, $190m in Santos and $83m in Whitehaven. While Australia is attending Cop27 to mitigate against climate disaster, and is asking the world to let us host a climate summit, our government is sinking money into the world’s biggest polluters. If the Future Fund is entrusted with paying for the public works needed to keep Australian communities safe from floods, fires, storm surges and cyclones moving south – then it needs to stop profiting from those companies making these natural disasters worse. Amy Remeikis has had to unexpectedly dash off today, so it’s Caitlin Cassidy here to keep the good times rolling. I’ll be with you for the next little while. We reported it a little earlier this morning, but here is Labor’s Stephen Jones’ whole comment on the criminals who have released some of the data they stole from Medibank: They’re scumbags, they’re crooks, they’re criminals, and we shouldn’t be paying ransom. We shouldn’t be giving in to these fraudsters and criminals. The moment we fold, it sends a green light to scumbags like them throughout the world that Australia is a soft target. We cannot give in. We won’t give in. All the more important that we lift our protection against cyber-threats and lift our protection against scams and fraudsters. That’s why we made our announcement earlier in this week about following through on our election commitment to set up an anti-scam centre. The best protection is ensuring that the data doesn’t get stolen in the first place. If that fails, we want to ensure that consumers are protected. So establishing an anti-scam centre inside the ACCC will provide consumers with the information and the protection they need and enable us to move quickly if some of these cyber-breaches lead to frauds and theft and scams going on in our economy. Coalition will support changes to laws governing ex-ADF personnel to safeguard national secrets, opposition says The Coalition has offered to support legal changes if required to safeguard Australia’s national secrets after the government announced a review of China’s alleged attempts to recruit former Australian defence force personnel. The opposition’s defence spokesperson, Andrew Hastie, has issued the following statement: Reports that ex-Australian fighter pilots were approached by Chinese interests to provide military training to the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) are deeply concerning. Such conduct, if these allegations are verified, is highly improper and contrary to the Australian national interest. Our national military secrets – including tactics, techniques and procedures for our elite fighter pilots – must be safeguarded by serving defence members and our veterans. They are not for sale to another country. The opposition therefore welcomes the Department of Defence examining current policies and procedures governing ex-ADF personnel who have served in classified and sensitive capabilities. The responsibility for protecting these national secrets does not cease when personnel separate from the ADF. It is a continuing obligation on our veterans and the ADF must ensure that this obligation has both moral and legal foundations. Hastie said the Coalition would welcome the opportunity to receive further information from the government on this matter. He added: Three weeks ago, the opposition stated that if legislation is required to deal with this matter, we will work closely with the government to further safeguard our sensitive national capabilities. Our position remains unchanged, and we trust the government is making this an urgent priority. Government to look at improving access to IUDs and other long-acting reversible contraception, Ged Kearney says The push for greater recognition of endometriosis and womens’ health more generally has come from female MPs from all sides of politics, which is why Labor, the Coalition and the Greens are happy to come together today to talk about the results of that push. The previous government had committed funding, and this government is continuing that commitment and is now starting the process to establish the clinics. Also good news – Ged Kearney says the government is looking at pain relief for IUD insertion. It is one of the most painful things you can go through, in terms of voluntary medical procedures – and most women are only told to take two Panadol for it, which is like handing someone who has lost a finger a Band-Aid and a pat on the stump. Kearney: We are looking at all of the barriers that women face, particularly accessing long acting reversible contraceptives, like IUDs. And we’re trying to get to the bottom of that – pain is certainly one that I’m hearing loud and clear. And it’s anything that we know from this issue that we’ve raised today, too often women’s experiences of pain are absolutely, well, not ignored, exactly, sometimes ignored, but dismissed and something that I really want to get to the bottom of. But there’s a lot of other barriers right now to women accessing LARCs, that’s one of them. Certainly, the number of doctors and general practitioners that actually … do it – people in rural and regional areas simply don’t have access to clinics that are available. So, who knows, maybe with this pelvic pain clinic, this is something that we can actually expand on and have these clinics actually deliver very specialty care. So yes, it’s something that we are very much looking at. Ged Kearney, the assistant health minister and Anne Ruston, the shadow health minister, have joined together for a bipartisan announcement of clinics for endometriosis and pelvic pain. Kearney: Today, we are finally on the hunt for clinics that will provide specific services to women with endometriosis and, I’m pleased to say, the broader issue of pelvic pain. As you would know, endometriosis affects one in nine women in Australia. And their diagnosis often is very long, takes far too long, is painful, because … all too often, women with pelvic pain are ignored. They’re told to just live with it, it’s just part of being a woman, when actually there are very serious issues that can be treated and we could do so much more for women with pelvic pain and endometriosis. So we have launched today the process to find 16 specific clinics right around Australia, who will provide very special services to women with pelvic pain, who may well have endometriosis. And if they do, they will be able to refer them on to specific services. We think that this will revolutionise care for women with endometriosis and we are really excited about it. In the hunt for the clinics, we will be taking into consideration things like geographical location – we know that women in rural and regional areas particularly have a great deal of trouble accessing services like this. We will make sure that clinics are able to scale up and provide care for extra patients coming from outside their area. We’ll make sure that they have an absolute commitment to upskilling their staff and providing special services around the area of endometriosis and pelvic pain. We’ll make sure that they are prepared to be culturally appropriate. So there’ll be a range of things that we will be looking at in this tender process for clinics to provide the service. Also, from 1 November we are very pleased to say that women who are having difficulty conceiving will be able to, on the MBS, get an MRI. This will also be life-changing for a lot of women who have tried to conceive for many, many years and have not been able to do so. It will also, of course, help diagnose those conditions which we know are a barrier to fertility like endometriosis and other conditions. Greens continue grilling Treasury on government’s housing accord The Greens are back to grilling Treasury on the housing accord and the government’s social housing policy. Senator Nick McKim asked about what definition of “affordable” will be used, and how many of the promised 1m homes under the accord would meet this definition. Laura Berger-Thomson from Treasury said that while no definition had been agreed to by all parties of the accord, this would be worked through. She said that the government had pledged 30,000 social and affordable homes under the Housing Affordability Fund, with an extra 10,000 promised by the government and another 10,000 from the states. Berger-Thomson said: There is general consensus around what is affordable in a broad sense and I think it is really is down to the specifics of whether ... it will include just rental stock or whether affordable homes to purchase will be included. She said an affordable rental would typically have rent at 80% of market rent. McKim asked whether any of the $350m pledged under the accord would go to private developers and investors. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, said the government’s preference was to go to community housing providers, but she would not play the “rule in, rule out” game. She said it was “unlikely” any government funds would go to private developers, but left the option open. Gallagher said: We are working with investors and I don’t want to ... lock down options to deliver the policy outcome. Big business has no incentive to fix recycling problem, Greens senator says The Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson isn’t impressed with Tanya Plibersek’s response to the revelations Coles and Woolworths soft plastics recycling programs aren’t happening: It’s unacceptable that once big packaging corporations whack a recycling label on packaging, the government thinks it can wipe its hands clean of responsibility. The government can’t keep passing the buck on recycling. Minister Plibersek today said it shouldn’t be beyond big companies like Coles and Woolworths to come up with a viable solution to soft plastic recycling. I’m disappointed with Minister Plibersek’s comments. The attitude and culture of governments leaving this problem to big business to sort out is why we’re in this mess. Big businesses have no incentive to fix the problem, they’re only interested in their bottom line. Australia’s recycling industry has been crying out for the government to introduce mandatory national packaging targets in order to have the confidence to invest in the infrastructure and technology necessary to recycle things like soft plastics right across the country. An export ban on sending plastics overseas for recycling should’ve provided a welcome boost for Australia’s recycling industry but successive governments have failed to take the most basic of steps to make us self-sufficient waste and recycling managers. If recycled content in packaging and government procurement of recycled content were mandated, we wouldn’t be in this mess. Every day the government fails to take meaningful action on recycling is another day our environment suffers and another day that Australians miss out on thousands of job opportunities that could be created in a true circular economy. The Greens have announced they will vote for the IR bill in the house (where the party’s vote isn’t needed to pass it) but will have more to say about it when it reaches the Senate (where the Greens vote does matter). The environment and water minister, Tanya Plibersek, says Coles and Woolworths need to “step up” and explain how they will deal with recycling soft plastics in the wake of the collapse of Australia’s biggest soft plastics recycler, REDCycle. Plibersek said: It shouldn’t be beyond these big supermarkets to come up with a viable solution to allow Australians to continue to recycle. I expect Coles and Woolworths to step up and indicate how they will deal with soft plastic recycling. We’re happy to work with them to achieve this. Their customers want to do the right thing, Coles and Woolworths should too. REDCycle announced the suspension of its programs on Tuesday night after the Age reported soft plastic items customers had dropped off at Coles and Woolworths supermarkets were being stockpiled in warehouses and not recycled. At last month’s meeting of environment ministers, there was agreement to work with the private sector on phasing out waste and pollution like ice cream wrappers and pasta packets by 2030. Plibersek said on Wednesday almost a billion pieces of soft plastic had been recovered by the REDCycle program since 2011 and the problems it was now facing were “unfortunate”: Like many Australians, I feel bad when I am forced to put soft plastics in landfill and I do my bit to take them down to my local supermarket to be recycled. I want to ensure Australians will be able to keep recycling their bread bags and plastic sachets. She said soft plastics were worth money, including to Coles and Woolworths, given plastics collected by REDCycle had been recycled into items such as Coles trolleys. They had also been used for roads, footpaths and garden edging. Plibersek said the government had set aside $60m to increase soft plastic recycling and provided $1m to the Australian Food and Grocery Council to work with industry to develop more sustainable solutions for their soft plastics. Ministers ‘have talked about it being important to have targets’ for national domestic violence plan: social services secretary Over in department of social services estimates, there seems to be some hint towards a target within the national plan to end violence against women and children. That came from questioning from the Greens senator Larissa Waters, who was asking questions of the deputy secretary of families and communities, Liz Hefren-Webb. Waters: Okay. Thank you. Is it the government’s aspiration to ensure that no one who seeks help from a frontline domestic family or sexual violence service is turned away for lack of resourcing? Hefren-Webb: So obviously the government’s expressed its aspiration to end violence against women and their children. But I think a target that’s around ensuring people have access to services and support when they need it is something that I think would be central to an action plan. Waters: So, okay, because obviously one of the key criticisms of the National Plan was the lack of measurable targets. So is that – you’ve just hinted – is that a target that could be in scope for either of the First Nations or the non-First Nations action plan? Hefren-Webb: It’s certainly an area where the government and ministers have talked about it being important to have targets, not only overall targets about prevalence, but targets about services and support and people being able to access what they need. Greens senator questions whether federal housing accord’s ‘aspirational target’ of 1m new homes is a ‘meaningless figure’ The Greens senator Nick McKim is asking Treasury about the government’s new housing accord, which has an “aspirational target” to build a million new homes in the five years from 2024-25. McKim is asking how many of the million would be built by the private sector regardless of the accord, pointing to the 995,000 homes built over the past five years. Laura Berger-Thomson from Treasury said that while the forecast over the next two years was for 180,000 housing starts a year, beyond that the number was expected to decline. Although we have the 180,000 completions over the next three years, given the rise in interest rates, we would expect that there’d be a decrease in homebuilding activity subsequent to that, as the effects of those interest rate rises kind of flow through to the construction sector, which we know is sensitive to interest rates. So I think our best guess ... given the economic situation, that there would actually be if there wasn’t kind of policies in place, there would actually be substantially less than the 1 million built … We’re confident that the one million homes is a target which actually does genuinely increase the supply of dwellings. McKim is questioning what the difference in housing stock would be without the accord. “It is a meaningless figure, isn’t it? McKim says. The finance minister, Katy Gallagher, emphasises that it is an aspirational target. It’s an aspirational target informed by the delivery of what’s happened over the past five years, and extra effort going in by the commonwealth states and the territories. The Liberal senator Anne Ruston is also asking whether the Treasury has done any modelling to show how many extra homes would be built under the accord. Somebody can’t live in an aspirational target, can they? The Greens senator David Shoebridge has also tried to push Treasury on the deductible gift recipient status granted by the former Coalition government to the Future Leaders Foundation charity of the governor general, David Hurley, but received few answers about the specific listing. Liberal senator accused of ‘inappropriate’ characterisation of social housing The Liberal senator Jane Hume has had a crack at the government’s focus on social housing amid discussion about the former Coalition’s Homebuilder program. Treasury officials have explained that the pandemic program, which was designed to boost demand and confidence in the market, had been budgeted to be worth $680m but blew out to $2.7bn. The program was uncapped and demand-driven. The program provided 24,000 grants to assist with renovations, of a total of about 105,247 grants. Laura Berger-Thomson from Treasury said the renovations “needed to be substantial”. Vera Holenstein, an assistant secretary at the Treasury, said the amount for the renovation needed to be between $150,000 and $750,000 for people to be eligible, with the aim to stimulate the construction industry. Labor senator Deb O’Neill asked whether there were any restrictions on what the money could be spent on, asking whether gold taps, bidets and swimming pools were allowed. Holenstein said an applicant needed to have an income under a certain amount, but was unable to provide the figure. She said swimming pools and granny flats were excluded, and the value of the property needed to be less than $1.5m. At this point, Hume interjected, saying: Put them in little boxes, little boxes of social housing, would be so much better The remark prompted O’Neill to call for Hume to withdraw the remark. [It] is an inappropriate way to characterise social housing and all Australians who grew up in it and rely on it and need that roof over their head. PM aims to emphasise commitment to net zero and regional stability at upcoming summits in Asia Anthony Albanese is about to hit the skies again. The prime minister is headed to international and regional summits in Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand from 11–19 November, including Asean, G20 and Apec. In a statement, Albanese said: Australia has always been an outward facing nation and we have never shied away from facing up to global challenges. The global economic outlook is stark, and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine has exacerbated the challenges of food insecurity, rising energy prices, rising inflation and cost of living pressures globally. Australia strongly supports Asean’s central role in the region and its vision for the region is closely aligned with our own. My role at these summits will be one of advocacy for not only Australians, but also for … our Pacific neighbours who face many of the same pressures that we do. At each summit I will emphasise Australia’s commitment to the global transition to net zero, and our vision for a stable, peaceful, resilient and prosperous region. I will remain, on behalf of the Australian people, a fierce opponent to Russia’s immoral and illegal invasion of Ukraine. I look forward to engaging my counterparts in Phnom Penh, Bali and Bangkok in the next week.” In the wake of a ransomware group beginning to publish Medibank customer data on the dark web overnight, the Australian federal police has announced that it will expand Operation Guardian – which was set up to protect the 10,000 Optus customers who had their personal information posted online earlier this year – to those Medibank customers exposed. AFP assistant commissioner cyber command, Justine Gough, said in a statement: Operation Guardian will be actively monitoring the clear, dark and deep web for the sale and distribution of Medibank Private and Optus data. Law enforcement will take swift action against anyone attempting to benefit, exploit or commit criminal offences using stolen Medibank Private data. Gough also said people should not try to download or access the data themselves, saying it may constitute a criminal offence. We use the powers and authorities of all of our agencies to disrupt the sale and distribution of the unlawfully-obtained data. Operation Pallidus is the investigation into the Medibank cyberattack itself. It is the other AFP operation in partnership with federal government agencies, and Five Eyes law enforcement including the FBI. Meeting with Chinese leaders would be ‘a positive thing moving forward’, PM says The prime minister, Anthony Albanese, has been asked if he will be meeting the Chinese premier, Li Keqiang, or president, Xi Jinping, at the forthcoming G20 and East Asia summit. Albanese said his trip will be a “very busy nine days” and the government is still finalising the program – but he left open the possibility. Albanese told reporters in Canberra: I’ve made very clear that dialogue is a good thing. And so if a meeting is arranged with Xi, then that’s a positive thing moving forward. We are organising a range of meetings – but they haven’t been finalised ... We’ll make an announcement if and when meetings with various leaders are locked in. Back to defence estimates and there has been an exchange concerning the basis for predictions by the former government that a guided weapons enterprise would eventually create more than 2,000 jobs across the supply chain. Greg Moriarty, the secretary of the department, said drily: “You’d need to ask the former prime minister. It was his press release.” Medibank has followed guidelines effectively: PM on stolen data release What is the government doing about the release of some of the stolen Medibank data which was reported overnight? Anthony Albanese: We are working with the security agencies as a government. We have also made sure we have been clear about the risk that is there, and this is really tough for people. I am a Medibank Private customer as well and it will be of concern that some of this information has been put out there. Can I say this, though? The company has followed the guidelines effectively, the advice, which is to not engage in a ransom payment. If you go down this road, then you end up with more difficulties potentially across a wider range. But we will through Clare O’Neil be responding extensively about this. We are concerned and we will continue to monitor what is occurring. We need to keep people’s information as safe as possible. There has been a real wake-up call for corporate Australia with both this breach and also the Optus breach that have occurred. We need to hear more good stories happening within the NDIS: Alcott There is another question about rorting in the NDIS and Dylan Alcott says: First and foremost, we have had four questions about the NDIS, they have all been negative. I’m starting by saying the NDIS is bloody awesome. We commissioned the NDIS report four months ago, the first half is about how good the NDIS is. We talked about early intervention before. One of the things we found out about this report, for kids with early intervention on the NDIS before the age of six [are more likely to have no] friends than kids [without early intervention]. I had no friends when I was five. I would like to have had the NDIS, do you know that? We don’t talk about the economic growth of it being involved in things like that. First and foremost, it is awesome, and we need to hear more stories about the good things that are happening. But secondly, you know, there are some dodgy people out there doing dodgy things, and the government have already commissioned … the fraud taskforce, and if you are watching this and you are doing the wrong thing, you are literally taking away from a neurodiversity kid getting care. You are taking away someone with a high level of disability having a shower. You are not taking away us having fast cars and stuff like that. That is not what it’s about. So remind yourself, if you are doing that, hey, you know what? I’m not going to try and do that anymore. People with disability should be allowed to be themselves: Alcott Dylan Alcott, the Australian of the Year who is launching “The Field” website then steps in to address that question Albanese was just asked: Just with disclosing people with disability especially, I’m going to put this down real quick. There are probably people with disability right here and you don’t know, because not all disabilities are physical. A lot of them are invisible, and it is not up to them to have to disclose to anybody about their disability. They can be their selves, right? But we want to create cultures in this country where everybody feels like they can be their authentic self when they go to work, right? And I think it is really exciting to frame it that way, where people go, you know what? I saw that today, I might apply for the job … they may be someone with neurodiversity, but being together and creating that community is really important. So yeah, we want to have targets, quotas, we want that employment rate to go up, we don’t want anyone with a disability to go out there and advocate for any disability or whatever they want to do, they just want to be themselves. You will be surprised even in this building the amount of people that actually do have some form of disability or mental health struggle and I think it is great that more and more people are feeling more included to be able to come out and talk about it. Politicians and businesses should take leadership role in employing people with disability: PM Anthony Albanese is asked whether he has people with disabilities working in his office and whether politicians need to take a leadership role: Yes, I think they do, and I have always, including in my ministerial office, had relationships with disability employment providers that have had people come through the office and then go on to other skills. We have people in the office for privacy reasons frankly, I’m not about to go into those issues of employment in my office, but it is something my office is very conscious of and I think all businesses, all the public sector, we can all of course do much better on those issues, but one of the things this is about with the field is showing that there are people out there who have skills, who want employment, and matching that up with employers. Launch of new website matching people with disabilities looking for work with employers Bill Shorten is holding a press conference with Anthony Albanese as part of “The Field” website launch with Dylan Alcott AO. That is a website designed to match people with disabilities who want to work, with employers. Shorten is asked though whether the government will review services available on the NDIS, with sex therapy given as one of the examples. Shorten says: Firstly, when it comes to services, there is a pretty clear defined operational guideline put in by the agency. We are reviewing the whole scheme – no doubt the process of what services are assessed to be reasonable and necessary will be part of the review but you should not take that to be a wholesale review and a lot of commonplace services will be scrapped. There is this one where people are able to access sexual therapies as a part of that system, can I just ask the media and I should say on that, I am not sure whatever the medical reasons may be and the full court has deemed it acceptable by the way, I am not sure ultimately taxpayers would see it as the appropriate use of the fund, but can I also just say, before we say people with disabilities are getting benefits they are not entitled to, that is not true. There are 500,000 people under the scheme and they are not getting exotic services or special things people see as unusual. 99.9999% of the scheme is going to what the scheme was set up for, wheelchairs, early intervention therapies, assistance animal. So when we talk about the scheme, it is important we don’t just blame people for the cost increases, our first priority is to tackle fraud and waste and administrative red tape. The Greens will be announcing their position on the IR bill just after 11am. We reported yesterday that Australia’s eSafety commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, had written to Elon Musk expressing concern over Twitter laying off around half of its workforce over the weekend and what that might mean for online safety on the social media platform. The letter has now been tabled in the Senate. In the letter, Inman Grant tells Musk she is “deeply concerned about the depth and breadth of recent cuts to Twitter staff across the globe and their potential impact on Twitter’s ability to respond to and comply with our regulatory requirements” under Australia’s online safety act. She says despite assurances that moderation is unaffected by the cuts, the broader layoffs in Twitter will have an impact in combating online abuse on the platform: Deep cuts to public policy, legal, communications, human rights, ethical AI and transparency teams leave me very concerned that Twitter is removing both the expertise and necessary guardrails to deal with the growing threat of hate, harm, disinformation and other forms of serious online abuse on the platform. She called on Twitter’s billionaire owner to assure her that the social media company will continue to comply with Australian law and respond to requests in a timely manner. For those wanting to keep an eye on America, you can follow along with the midterm vote results here: Here is the story Adeshola was referencing in her post: So what does that mean? Well, Australia is committed to contributing to the Pacific Islands. And Australia is bidding to hold a Cop with the Pacific Islands in 2026. This Cop isn’t asking for contributions to the fund just yet – it is just discussing the establishment of one. So Australia is having the discussion, but at this stage is keeping its options open between direct contributions to the Pacific or re-committing those contributions to the fund (which it would not have control of). Chris Bowen on Australia contributing to a loss and damage climate fund Here is a little more from Chris Bowen this morning. He isn’t committing Australia to contributing to the loss and damage fund, but he is also not not committing Australia to it. Firstly, Australia supports loss and damage being on the agenda. That’s a change. I think Peter Dutton is showing, frankly, that he would continue a wrecking approach to international negotiations if he were to become prime minister. The two big changes at this Cop are the changes in government of Australia and Brazil, which means there are two constructive governments where previously they were wrecking governments. Now on loss and damage, what is loss and damage? Loss and damage is assisting developing countries deal with the impacts of climate change on their countries. And I’m pleased that Australia has supported loss and damage getting onto the agenda. Now, in relation to compensation: the incoming president of the Cop, minister Shoukry has made it clear and the agenda makes it clear, this is not about compensation. This is about development assistance, working with countries, facilitating cooperation. And we have a particular focus on the Pacific here. And of course, we’ve increased our foreign aid by $1.4bn in the budget, for example, with a strong focus on the Pacific and introduced a new Pacific Climate Fund as part of our agenda that we are implementing since the election. So we are getting on with that. But we’re also coming to the table as constructive engagers in this conversation. Now with Egypt, the new Cop president wants to take this conversation and use this to progress further discussions about financing to be determined in 2024. So finalised in 2024. We’re engaged in that, we’re constructive, Peter Dutton is showing that he would not be constructive in that. There is a difference of approach in that. Australia is back as a constructive player at the table. Under Peter Dutton we would not. Defence aware of recruitment concerns before it became subject of media reporting last month The review announced by Richard Marles today is focused on defence policies rather than investigation into individuals. But the secretary of the Department of Defence, Greg Moriarty, told the committee that if defence became aware of any potential breaches it would engage with law enforcement agencies and would support any such investigative work. Speaking generally about the obligation of former ADF personnel and others to protect official secrets, Moriarty says: “That sticks with them for the rest of their life.” Defence is working with the counter-foreign interference task force: We are collaborating very closely with the other security agencies. I wish nature of that collaboration and the information being shared to remain confidential. Privacy bill increasing penalties for data breaches passes parliament The privacy laws which were sped up in response to the data hacks passed the parliament overnight. The laws increase the maximum penalties for serious or repeated privacy breaches from the current $2.22m to whichever is the greater of: $50m; Three times the value of any benefit obtained through the misuse of information; or 30% of a company’s adjusted turnover in the relevant period. The bill also provides the Australian Information Commissioner with greater powers to resolve privacy breaches and quickly share information about data breaches to help protect customers. House of Representatives debates Labor’s IR bill The House of Representatives is discussing the secure jobs, better pay bill, which leader of the house Tony Burke has fast-tracked. The crossbench and Liberals have moved amendments. MP Allegra Spender wants an inquiry into parts dealing with flexible work, bargaining changes and single interest multi-employer bargaining. MP Rebekha Sharkie wants an inquiry into the abolition of the Australian Building and Construction Commission and Registered Organisations Commission, and has called on the government to expand the carveout for small business from multi-employer bargaining to including medium-sized businesses up to 100 employees. Liberal leader Peter Dutton has moved that the House should decline to give the bill a second reading and call on the government to: (1)give the Australian Parliament three months to review these significant changes rather than trying to force through the legislation this year; (2)amend the legislation to exclude changes to multi-employer bargaining which will lead to more strikes and fewer jobs without increasing productivity or wages; (3)admit to the Australian people that these extreme industrial relations changes will result in significant red tape and higher costs for small, family and medium businesses; (4)work with the Opposition, crossbench and other stakeholders to make improvements to the Better Off Overall Test and changes to enterprise bargaining as outlined in the former Coalition Government’s legislation introduced in 2020; (5)abandon the move to abolish the Australian Building and Construction Commission and the Registered Organisations Commission; (6)redraft this legislation to ensure matters are dealt with separately rather than as an “all or nothing” approach; and (7)in the event the bill is passed, an independent review be conducted of the operation of the amendments made by this Act as soon as practical 12 months after the bill receives Royal Assent and cause a copy of the report to be tabled in each House of Parliament Coalition questions Labor on recosting stage-three tax cuts Liberal senator Andrew Bragg is questioning treasury officials and the finance minister Katy Gallagher about the recosting of the stage-three tax cuts. The Coalition believes this line of questioning shows that the government was toying with scrapping the stage-three tax cuts. We know that the cabinet was considering tweaking or changing the tax cuts which overwhelmingly benefit higher income earners, and which are now forecast to cost $254bn over a decade. Deputy secretary of revenue Diane Brown said the department had costed a range of measures to give the government “a complete understanding of what are the pressures in the budget”. “I don’t think it’s unusual that an incoming government handing down a budget within its first few months would seek a whole range of information...in order to inform decision making”. “We’re just doing our job, mate,” Gallagher says. Bragg asked if “every tax setting under the purview of the government” was recosted, and questioned if there had been a precedent. Treasury confirmed this was not the case. “The answer to that is no. But if I might also add, it’s not really a matter of precedent here. We cost policies on request of government and if the government seeks advice we will cost them.” Bragg asks what other tax measures had been costed: “What were the tax policy issues that were costed? Are they all in the budget or were some cut?” Gallagher said some were in the budget, and the government sought a “range of information” from Treasury about tax policy in the lead up to the budget. “A lot of this will be covered by cabinet in confidence, because that is essentially how it operates,” she says. Brown said the request was not a request to cost the removal. “I wouldn’t characterise it as a request for the removal of stage three, it was a request for a costing in order to understand pressures in the budget ... the spending and revenue profile of the budget,” she said. Daniel Andrews says contact tracing data sent to federal agency was ‘de-identified’ Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, has played down criticism of his government sending contact tracing data to a federal agency, stressing that the information was de-identified. Guardian Australia has revealed that in July 2020 – during the height of Covid – the Victorian government sent contact tracing data to the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission in the hope a controversial data mining platform could identify the source of mystery cases. The Victorian department of health did not proceed with the platform but data security experts have described the move as “dubious” and “outrageous”. Asked if Victorians deserved to know about the use of the data, Andrews said it was “de-identified” information. Victoria’s health minister Mary-Anne Thomas said the data was not used on the platform. The important point of the story is that we did not proceed down that route. At Senate estimates committee hearing, Defence officials are being asked about concerns about ex-ADF personnel being approached to provide training to China. Celia Perkins, a deputy secretary at the Department of Defence, doesn’t give numbers but she tells the committee: We are aware and have been made aware through engagement with security agencies that former ADF personnel may have been approached to provide military-related training services. Perkins says these are “quite sensitive national security matters” and so she is limited in what she can say. But she says that “all our people but particularly our highly trained people” are “attractive targets”. Perkins says there is an “onus on us” to support former ADF personnel and build deep awareness in community that “foreign actors will target our people for the unique skills they have”. She says the terms of reference of the detailed review announced by Richard Marles today are classified, but the intention is to look at adequacy of the policies in place for serving and former ADF regarding employment after they leave the ADF. Perkins is leading the review and she has undertaken to report back to the deputy prime minister by 14 December. Richard Marles wouldn’t go into any detail, but here is the story of the extradition that was referenced in that press conference; NAB reports cash earnings of more than $7bn for 2022 NAB have posted their earnings for the financial year, AAP reports – and if you own shares, it is good news. If you have a loan with NAB, here is some of where that interest rate increases have gone: National Australia Bank has bumped up annual earnings to more than $7bn following a “pleasing” year during which it reaped the rewards of rising interest rates. Australia’s largest business-focused bank reported cash earnings of $7.1bn for fiscal 2022, up 8.3% from the previous year. Cash earnings are the banking industry’s preferred measure of operational strength because it strips out volatile and one-off items. NAB’s bottom line net profit also rose 8.3 per cent, to $6.9bn, in the year ending 30 September. “Our FY22 results are pleasing,” CEO Ross McEwan said on Wednesday. The result was attributed to volume growth and cost management, and interest rates. “After 11 years of interest rate reductions, earnings have also benefited in FY22 from the rising interest rate environment,” McEwan added. Borrowing rates have been rising steadily since May when the central bank first began hiking the cash interest rate from a historical low of 0.1%. Defence minster’s press conference on reports China approached ex-ADF personnel Here is the questions Richard Marles did answer: Q: Have you confirmed that any Australians have actually provided this training to China? And is there going to be an approach to the Chinese government to say this is not acceptable? Marles: You’ll forgive me that I’m not going to answer that question. But defence is supporting the Joint AFP-Asio Counter Foreign Interference Taskforce, which is currently investigating a number of cases. Q: How many cases, can you clarify how many cases? Is this related to a specific incident that kicked us off? And is this for any relation to that pilot facing extradition? Marles: Again, I’m not going to answer that question for obvious reasons, but the taskforce that I’ve described is investigating a number of cases. What we are focused on right now is making sure that we do examine the policies and the procedures that are currently in place in respect of our former defence personnel to make sure they are adequate. And if they are not, and if there are weaknesses in that system, then we are absolutely committed to fixing them. Australia should remove ‘unnecessary discrimination’ from blood donations: Liberal MP The Liberal MP for Bass, Bridget Archer, spoke in the parliament last night about the need to remove discrimination from blood donations: I want to make it clear that I’m in no way demonising the critical work of Lifeblood Australia, and I understand the need for precautions. However, there is now research available indicating that a move to implementing criteria based on sexual-behaviour-based screening for all donors, regardless of gender and orientation, would be considered safe. The UK and Canada moved to this model very recently, and Australia should follow. I understand that the Therapeutic Goods Administration is reviewing the report submitted by Just.Equal Australia, and I’m hopeful for an outcome that will both protect the blood donation supply in Australia and remove unnecessary discrimination. The IR legislation debate will resume this morning. Richard Marles just released this statement: Last month we heard concerning reports that ex-Australian Defence Force personnel may have been approached to provide military related training to China. At the time, I asked my Department to urgently investigate these reports. The information provided to me so far presents enough evidence to warrant the need for a detailed examination into the adequacy of current Defence policies and procedures addressing this matter. I have therefore instructed the Department to commence that process. It’s no secret that Defence activities, people and assets are targets for Foreign Intelligence Services. But let me be clear: Australians who work or have worked for the government in any capacity, particularly our ADF, who come into possession of the nation’s secrets, have an obligation to maintain those secrets beyond their employment with, or their engagement with, the Commonwealth. This is an enduring obligation and to reveal any of those secrets is a crime. It’s clear and unambiguous. We already have a range of layered policies in place to protect Defence people, information and assets from foreign collection but if there are weaknesses in our system the Albanese Government will strengthen them. I thank Defence for their urgent work to date on this matter. We will have more to say upon receiving the recommendations in due course. The Victorian election continues: And then he left, as questions were still being asked. Joint AFP-Asio taskforce investigating ‘a number of cases’: Marles Q: Have you confirmed that any Australians have provided this training to China? And is there going to be an approach to the Chinese government to say that this is not acceptable, what’s happened? Richard Marles: You’ll forgive me that I’m not going to answer that question. But defence is supporting the joint AFP-Asio, counter-foreign interference taskforce, which is currently investigating a number of cases. Q: How many cases, can you clarify, how many cases? Is this relating to a specific incident that kicked this off? Has it got any relation to the pilot facing extradition? Marles: Again, I’m not going to answer that question for obvious reasons but the taskforce I’ve described is investigating a number of cases. What we are focused on right now is making sure that we do examine the policies and procedures that are currently in place in respect of our former defence … to make sure they are adequate. And if there are not and there are weaknesses in the system, we are committed to fixing them. Thank you. The deputy prime minister is in the Blue Room (the second most fancy press conference location) where he is speaking about his order for a “detailed examination” of the procedures which apply to former defence personnel who “come into possession of our nation’s secrets”. Richard Marles says he has received reports that ex-ADF personnel may have been approached to provide military training in China. This press conference came up very quickly – and there wasn’t a lot of detail in it. I want to make this point – for those who do come into possession of our nation’s secrets, either through service in the Australian Defence Force, or, indeed, service in any other part of the commonwealth, there is an enduring obligation to maintain those secrets for as long as they are secrets, which persists well after their engagement with the commonwealth. And to breach that obligation is a very serious crime. And that is clear and unambiguous. Having said that, it’s really important that we have the most robust framework possible that is in place to protect Australia’s information and protect our secrets. And so as defence undertakes this examination, which it is doing right now, if there are any weaknesses in the policies and procedures that do currently apply in respect of our former defence personnel, then the Albanese Labor government is absolutely committed to fixing those weaknesses so as to keep Australia safe. AAP reports assistant treasurer Stephen Jones has had a bit to say about the Medibank cyber criminals on Sky News: They’re scumbags, they’re crooks, they’re criminals and we shouldn’t be paying ransom. We shouldn’t be giving in to these fraudsters. The moment we fold it sends a green light to scumbags like them throughout the world that Australia is a soft target. We cannot give in and we won’t give in.” Penny Wong speaks with Chinese foreign minister Foreign minister Penny Wong had a phone call with Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi overnight. There isn’t a lot of detail – the official read out is “the two discussed a range of bilateral issues, including trade and consular matters”. But it is noteworthy as it seems to be another step towards Anthony Albanese and Xi Jinping meeting. Which is again, noteworthy because it will be the first time Xi has met an Australian prime minister since Malcolm Turnbull (and there has been A LOT of water under the bridge since then). Intergenerational wealth and inequality in Australia There is a small, but determined campaign bubbling away in the background of the political agenda to start talking about intergenerational wealth and its role in inequality. WA independent MP Kate Chaney spoke about it in the Federation chamber (the third chamber of parliament where speeches the House doesn’t have time for live) on Tuesday. I rise today to talk about the changing economic relationship between the generations in Australia. Australia’s millennial generation is widely forecast to be the first generation since Federation that has worse economic outcomes than the generation before. Individual wealth of older households is increasing significantly faster than those of their younger counterparts. In fact, the gap between the wealth of the old and the wealth of the young almost doubled over the last few decades. I want to talk about how we need to address the implicit generational bargain that underpins the relationship between younger and older Australians, and how we set our tax and spending priorities. Intergenerational economic fairness is an issue that we need to fix if we want our communities to enjoy rising living standards. This must be done in the context of a wider community discussion about what we care about. Which means, Chaney says, it is time to talk about tax: While no one likes to talk about tax, this is not a problem that will fix itself. We need to either reduce our expectations of support or be open to new ways of paying for it. This was raised a decade ago in Ken Henry’s review of the tax system but not much has changed. Understanding generational differences in what we value and how we want to live through an intergenerational fairness inquiry would inform longer term thinking and provide a mandate for some of the economic reform that has ground to a halt over the last decade. At the last election, communities such as mine in Curtin indicated that they wanted to see longer-term thinking in policy development and an optimistic and courageous vision for the future of the country. Now is the time to start these national conversations: What is important to us? How does our tax and spending system reflect what we value? How do we make good on the intergenerational bargain to support people at the vulnerable beginning and end of life in exchange for the promise that we will keep making things better? I’ll continue to work with the government and other stakeholders to support these longer-term discussions to ensure that we’re focusing on the things that matter and making structural decisions that do not unfairly burden our children and their children. Federal government paying contractor $900,000 for review of naval shipbuilding The federal government is paying a contractor $900,000 to carry out a new review of naval shipbuilding issues with the findings due by January. The three-month contract for Rand Corporation is the latest in a series of defence reviews that are due early next year. The big-picture defence strategic review, headed by Stephen Smith and Angus Houston, and the nuclear-powered submarine taskforce plans are also due in the first few months of 2023. Rand Corporation is carrying out the “Strategic Shipbuilding Review” for the Department of Defence on a three-month $900,000 contract, AusTender records show. It is believed to be an update of Rand’s 2015 naval shipbuilding review. That earlier work looked at the “capability of the shipbuilding and ship repair industrial bases in Australia to meet the demands of current and future naval surface ship programs”. Defence may face questions about the matter at Senate estimates today. Bringing nuclear submarines into service will be Australia’s biggest challenge, academic warns Bringing a fleet of nuclear-powered submarines into service will be one of the biggest training and workforce development challenges Australia has ever faced, a leading academic warns. Prof Brian Schmidt, the vice-chancellor of the Australian National University, will talk about the difficulties of making the Aukus agreement a reality when he addresses the Submarine Institute of Australia Conference in Canberra today: Australia has the expertise and capability. What we don’t have yet is the scale to deliver the graduates and skills in the quantities required … I’m here to tell you today is that whatever submarine design ends up being chosen, we won’t be able to build and operate it locally unless we address the fundamental issue of Australia’s workforce capability gap. Schmidt will say the nuclear workforce “will need to include not just engineers and physicists, but also lawyers, regulatory experts, specialist medical staff, naval architects and policy advisers to decision-makers.” He will urge the government to establish “an Aukus career pathways program to harness high-achieving school-age students and provide long-term development and career progression in critical skills”: Nuclear science should clearly be the first cab off the rank for this program, but this approach will also be necessary across the broader advanced capabilities of Aukus including in cyber and computing, engineering, space and quantum physics. An Aukus pathways program, jointly developed with Defence, could feature a portfolio of tailored degree programs providing a pathway for students to gain qualifications in an Aukus-related field and then progress to a position in Defence working on Aukus programs. He also suggests processing security clearances for students while they are studying “to enable real work experience and practical placement opportunities with Defence”. He suggests international exchanges with US and UK partner universities. Supermarket plastic bags not being recycled Nine newspapers have reported this morning that the plastic Coles and Woolworths encourage their customers to bring back to the store to recycle is not being recycled, but stored in warehouses, because Redcycle can’t find anyone to recycle the bags and soft plastics. Tanya Plibersek doesn’t think that is good enough. What is the government doing about energy prices? Chris Bowen: Our intention will be to ensure that energy prices don’t rise by the amount that’s indicated by the rising gas and coal which is being brought about by the international crisis, which governments around the world are dealing with. Again, the opposition seems to think that Ukraine hasn’t been invaded and coal and gas prices haven’t gone up. They seem to think that this is all the fault of renewable energy, which again shows the 10 years of denial and delays continuing into opposition. We’re not doing that. But obviously energy prices impact on inflation. The treasurer made that very clear in the lead-up to the budget that the main inflationary pressure is energy prices in Australia. Hence, that’s one of the reasons why we’re going to deal with it. Peter Dutton ‘hasn’t moved on from cracking jokes’ about climate change: Bowen Chris Bowen keeps using the word “constructive” there because he is also making the point that Peter Dutton, who does not seem to be in support of the “loss and damage” fund, is not being constructive. He’s doubling down on 10 years of denial, delay and distraction. That’s okay. We’re not. We’re doubling down on constructive engagement as a responsible international citizen, and Patricia as the prime minister made very clear and very strongly, this point yesterday in parliament, we also regard this as a matter of geopolitical national security. I mean, the stability of our region, comes very much down to cooperation on climate. We’re back at the table. Peter Dutton, you know, really hasn’t moved on from cracking jokes about the water lapping at Pacific islands, frankly, which is a bit sad, but that’s the reality. Australia being ‘constructive’ on climate action heading into Cop27: Bowen Energy minister Chris Bowen is speaking to Patricia Karvelas on ABC radio RN Breakfast, where he is being asked whether Australia should sign up to the “loss and damage fund” being discussed at the UN Cop27 conference. The fund in its most basic form is wealthy countries contributing towards mitigating the damage from climate change in developing nations. Australia is in support of the loss and damage fund being discussed at the conference, but Bowen says there is no fund as yet to contribute to. And he won’t go into whether Australia would contribute to a fund, if one was set up. As I said our focus has been on improving aid to the Pacific, working with our Pacific friends. We welcome the comments from the PIF [Pacific Island Forum] chair overnight about Australia’s role here that’s been very, very welcome and has been very constructive, and recognised Australia’s role developing the Pacific climate facility financing facility which we took to the election and we are implementing, that’s the job we’re getting on and doing and we’re also being constructive. Welcome to the Wednesday parliament sitting, where estimates will continue to mean everyone inside the parliament is annoyed about something. It’s been that sort of week. Because this government is still relatively new, estimates has been a mix of things the last government did and changes this government has made since taking over the treasury reins. So both opposition and government senators are asking the department officials targeted questions and then doing what they can to make those answers the narrative of the day. Meanwhile in the House, the government is pushing the last bits of the legislation it wants to get passed by the end of the year, which has meant we are also talking IR, Respect@Work and the national anti-corruption commission. It means that the final two weeks are going to be an absolute mess as everyone tries to stick to the plan, with the Senate, as always, the place to watch. But first we have to get through hump day. The Medibank data hack will be one of the big issues of the day, with reports (see below) that some data stolen from the health insurer has been posted, after Medibank refused to pay a ransom (a position supported by the Australian government). And of course, the cost of living and particularly energy prices will continue to dominate the political conversation – ahead of Chris Bowen leaving for Cop27. Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Daniel Hurst, Josh Butler and Paul Karp will be all across what is happening in the parliament, and you have me, Amy Remeikis for the majority of the day on the blog. I am on my fourth coffee and given its Wednesday, I made the sensible choice and had a piece of banana cake for breakfast. Ready? Let’s get into it. A ransomware group has begun posting client data apparently stolen from Australia’s largest health insurer on the dark web, AAP reports. Hundreds of names, addresses, birthdates and Medicare details were being posted under “good-list” and “naughty-list” on a blog belonging to the group. The hackers had demanded a ransom to stop them from releasing the data, but Medibank earlier this week said it would not pay it because it would encourage further crime. Shortly after midnight, the group posted the first lists. “Looking back that data is stored not very understandable format (table dumps) we’ll take some time to sort it out,” they said in the early hours of Wednesday. “We’ll continue posting data partially, need some time to do it pretty.” The hackers also appeared to have revealed screenshots of private messages recently exchanged between themselves and Medibank representatives. Medibank has previously confirmed almost 500,000 health claims were stolen by the hackers, along with personal information, when the unnamed group hacked into its system weeks ago. Some 9.7 million current and former customers have been affected. No credit card or banking details were accessed. On Tuesday, the ransomware group posted to its blog that “data will be publish (sic) in 24 hours”. “P.S. I recommend to sell (sic) medibank stocks.” Medibank apologised again to clients past and present on Tuesday. It advised customers to be alert for any phishing scams via phone, post or email. “We knew the publication of data online by the criminal could be a possibility but the criminal’s threat is still a distressing development for our customers,” CEO David Koczkar said on Tuesday. Home affairs minister Clare O’Neil said Medibank’s decision not to pay a ransom to cyber criminals was in line with government advice. Lunar eclipse images from across Australia And in case you didn’t see it yourself, photographers were out and about to snap the lunar eclipse that was visible across the country last night. Hi, Martin Farrer here. Welcome to our live blog. Amy Remeikis will be here soon to start the day’s politics coverage, but let’s get the ball rolling with some of the main news stories this morning. Former prime minister John Howard has led tributes to his “great friend” Peter Reith, who has died at the age of 72. Reith was deputy leader of the Liberal party in the Howard era and served as minister for industrial relations and defence among others. But while Liberal politicians paid tribute to his “conviction” style of politics, others have remembered his role in the notorious “children overboard” claims about asylum seekers during the 2001 election campaign and his fight against dock workers in 1998. Melissa Davey, our medical editor, has an exclusive story this morning about how the Victorian government sent Covid contact tracing data to the national crime authority for potential use by the data mining firm Palantir. Experts said the move was “dubious” and “outrageous”. Senate estimates last night revealed more detail about Scott Morrison’s secret ministerial portfolios. Meghan Quinn, secretary of the Department of Industry, Science and Resources, told a hearing that officials from Morrison’s department asked their counterparts in the industry department to provide a briefing to the prime minister on the Pep-11 gas project in December 2021, because Morrison had designated himself the decision-maker. Asked whether then resources minister Keith Pitt had received the same briefing, Quinn said: “I don’t believe so.” Sri Lankan cricketer Danushka Gunathilaka will appear in court in Sydney today over the alleged sexual assault of a woman. More questions about the conduct of the squad have emerged overnight after Sri Lanka Cricket launched an investigation into “various alleged incidents” involving its players in Australia during the T20 World Cup.","charCount":"124987","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/stephanie-convery\">Stephanie Convery</a>, <a href=\"profile/caitlin-cassidy\">Caitlin Cassidy</a> and <a href=\"profile/amy-remeikis\">Amy Remeikis</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/09/john-fetterman-wins-pennsylvania-senate-race","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T07:30:40Z","webTitle":"Fetterman defeats Oz in Pennsylvania Senate race, giving Democrats a boost","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/09/john-fetterman-wins-pennsylvania-senate-race","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/09/john-fetterman-wins-pennsylvania-senate-race","fields":{"headline":"Fetterman defeats Oz in Pennsylvania Senate race, giving Democrats a boost","standfirst":"<p>Victory overturns a Republican-held Senate seat and increases his party’s chances of retaining control of chamber</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/nov/08/midterm-election-results-live-2022-map-us-midterms-latest-winners-seats-congress\">US midterm election results 2022: live</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/09/midterm-elections-2022-results-senate-house-us-democrats-republicans-live-updates-latest-news\">US midterm elections 2022 – latest live news updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Victory overturns a Republican-held Senate seat and increases his party’s chances of retaining control of chamber","byline":"Adam Gabbatt in Pittsburgh","main":"<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"19ce7aea-4d8f-47ab-b7dd-efe6b361b2ae\" data-atom-type=\"media\"> \n  <div>\n   <iframe frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"true\" src=\"https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bMtNEH2LztY?showinfo=0&amp;rel=0\"></iframe>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure>","body":"<p>The Democratic party received a huge boost in Pennsylvania in the early hours of Wednesday morning, when John Fetterman won the state’s US Senate race to increase his party’s chances of retaining control of the chamber.</p> \n<p>Fetterman was declared the winner over Mehmet Oz, the Republican celebrity doctor, six hours after the polls closed, overturning a Republican-held Senate seat to bolster Democrats’ chances of retaining the chamber.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/09/election-night-key-takeaways\">Where’s the red wave?

The Democrat, who suffered a stroke in May which has impacted his ability to speak and process the sound of others’ speech, spent months ahead of Oz in the polls, but the race had tightened in recent weeks after a disappointing performance from Fetterman in a debate.

The agriculture minister, Dugald Saunders, introduced a bill on Wednesday that critics said would water down the regulation of forestry in the state. Sitting independent MPs and candidate hopefuls alike jumped on the proposal, accusing the Liberal party of bowing to pressure from the Nationals, flagging they would campaign on the issue ahead of the March state poll. Under environmental planning laws, councils have the power to require landowners to obtain a development approval if they wish to undertake logging on their properties. Saunders’ proposal would remove that power from councils, which the independent upper house MP Justin Field said would open up more industrial native forest logging on private land, including in koala habitat. “It’s crazy for Premier Perrottet and the so-called moderate Liberals to capitulate again to the Nationals on koala protections so close to an election,” Field said. “Putting aside that it is terrible policy and further undermines koala protections, it’s crazy politics.” Field said the decision would gift “teal” candidates “a perfect example of the Nationals’ disproportionate power over environmental issues within the Coalition”.

Pittwater is being vacated by the outgoing minister Rob Stokes. The families and communities minister, Natasha Maclaren-Jones, has put her name forward for preselection. The changes were recommended by a Shooters, Fishers and Farmers-chaired inquiry into the timber industry, but that recommendation was not supported by Labor and Field. The opposition leader, Chris Minns, on Wednesday said he was “concerned that this could affect the native habitat of koalas” and would “scrutinise” the legislation. Local Government NSW, which represents councils, called the bill a “repeat of the infamous ‘koala wars’ of 2020”. Its president, Darriea Turley, said the bill had been rushed to parliament without any consultation with local government. “This bill undermines the crucial role councils play in the regulation of private forestry operations,” she said. “It will have devastating impacts on important native habitats, particularly for koalas and many of the state’s other threatened species.” The legislation was introduced a day after the Greens introduced a bill proposing a ban on native forestry operations in koala habitat. The party’s environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the current dual consent provisions were vital to allow councils to have any control over the destruction of forests, koala habitat or neighbourhood issues associated with forestry. “This is a disastrous, desperate and divisive move by the government,” she said.","charCount":"4548","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/lisa-cox\">Lisa Cox</a> and <a href=\"profile/tamsin-rose\">Tamsin Rose</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"food/2022/nov/09/i-miss-eating-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-food-repulsive","type":"article","sectionId":"food","sectionName":"Food","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T06:00:23Z","webTitle":"‘I miss eating’: the truth behind the weight loss drug that makes food repulsive","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/food/2022/nov/09/i-miss-eating-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-food-repulsive","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/food/2022/nov/09/i-miss-eating-weight-loss-drug-ozempic-food-repulsive","fields":{"headline":"‘I miss eating’: the truth behind the weight loss drug that makes food repulsive","standfirst":"<p>In Beverly Hills’ doctors offices, celebrities are clamoring for Ozempic prescriptions – but what are the costs of the supposed wonder drug?</p>","trailText":"In Beverly Hills’ doctors offices, celebrities are clamoring for Ozempic prescriptions – but what are the costs of the supposed wonder drug?","byline":"John Semley","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"5ed7403de53cbcf1f5e8fcbbae34c5c7610c6abb\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/5ed7403de53cbcf1f5e8fcbbae34c5c7610c6abb/0_0_5168_3102/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ozempic makes people find food revolting, acting like an appetite suppressant.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ozempic makes people find food revolting, acting like an appetite suppressant.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: ViChizh/Shutterstock</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p><br>“Everyone’s on it,” says Dr Daniel Ghiyam whose “medical spa” in Ventura county, California, offers skin tightening, body contouring, vaginal rejuvenation and, lately, injections of Semaglutide, the active ingredient in a new drug called Ozempic. To hear Ghiyam tell it, these injections are Hollywood’s worst-kept secret.</p> <p>“A lot of celebrities are on it,” he says. “Everyone’s who’s not talking about it is on the stuff.”</p> <p>Ozempic has become so popular in the last two years because it makes people lose weight fast. It’s so controversial because of the way it works: by triggering a chemical repugnance to food itself. After being injected with Ozempic, a user could try to imagine a moist slab of black forest gateau, or a calorically-dense, half-pound Baconator bacon cheeseburger from Wendy’s, and their body physically revolts, with spasms of nausea and waves of ill feeling. It’s the chemical realization of a behavioral psychologist’s wildest dream; A Clockwork Orange for junk food, an eating disorder in an injection.</p> <p>On TikTok, videos documenting Ozempic-assisted weight loss have racked up <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/tag/ozempic\">hundreds of millions of views</a>. Elsewhere on the internet, speculation that Ozempic has <a href=\"https://katiecouric.com/health/ozempic-shortage-2022/\">catalyzed the drastic body transformations of celebrities</a> runs wild.<strong> </strong>A number of musicians and actors told the Guardian that they personally knew high-profile people in their industries using Ozempic, although none would go on record. Ghiyam has joined in on the publicity push himself, with his own informational #OzempicWeightLoss TikToks reeling in hundreds of thousands of views.</p> <p>The world’s wealthiest individual, Elon Musk, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1518222204097413122?lang=en\">has also praised the drug</a>, publicly and unabashedly.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"149de9afe6589dd766c6dc82c66f62b97a82c0c5\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/149de9afe6589dd766c6dc82c66f62b97a82c0c5/0_182_5472_3283/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Person with a tape measure around their waist.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">One of Ozempic’s side effects is that it reduces appetite – leading to weight loss.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: FotoDuets/Getty Images/iStockphoto</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Ozempic is also advertised regularly on TV: the ubiquitous commercials feature various characters who, having stabilized their blood sugar levels, are living healthy, active lives. “Oh!” they exclaim, turning to the camera, barely containing their excitement, as the soundtrack – set to the earwormy melody of Magic, the breakout 1974 single by Scottish soft-rockers Pilot – crescendos. <em>Oh! Oh! Oh! Ozeeeeempic! </em></p> <p>But the ad mentions weight loss only as an afterthought. In the motormouth recitation of precautions and potential side effects that underscore pharmaceutical ads, the voiceover says off-handedly “You may lose weight!” to which a chipper character responds, “Oh!”</p> <p>That’s because Ozempic is not being marketed as a weight loss drug. It’s sold as a diabetes medication.</p> <p>It’s gained traction in the medical community for its ability to lower blood sugar, or rein in levels of glycated hemoglobin (also known as A1C), often transforming the lives of patients.</p> <p>One of its corollary effects however, is that it makes patients want to eat less. And so doctors are increasingly prescribing the drug off-label, purely for its effect helping people lose weight.</p> <p>Trish Wheeler is one of thousands of Ozempic users. For years, she had exercised and eaten right. She’d even been profiled in a fitness magazine. But as she got a little older, and her body transitioned into menopause, she found her usual habits were no longer doing the trick. “Dieting was not working,” Wheeler, 53, says, “and my joints were hurting enough that I couldn’t strenuously exercise anymore”.</p> <p>When the pandemic hit, the situation got even worse and, as Wheeler puts it, “the weight just piled on”.

To hear Ghiyam tell it, these injections are Hollywood’s worst-kept secret. “A lot of celebrities are on it,” he says. “Everyone’s who’s not talking about it is on the stuff.” Ozempic has become so popular in the last two years because it makes people lose weight fast. It’s so controversial because of the way it works: by triggering a chemical repugnance to food itself. After being injected with Ozempic, a user could try to imagine a moist slab of black forest gateau, or a calorically-dense, half-pound Baconator bacon cheeseburger from Wendy’s, and their body physically revolts, with spasms of nausea and waves of ill feeling. It’s the chemical realization of a behavioral psychologist’s wildest dream; A Clockwork Orange for junk food, an eating disorder in an injection. On TikTok, videos documenting Ozempic-assisted weight loss have racked up hundreds of millions of views. Elsewhere on the internet, speculation that Ozempic has catalyzed the drastic body transformations of celebrities runs wild. A number of musicians and actors told the Guardian that they personally knew high-profile people in their industries using Ozempic, although none would go on record. Ghiyam has joined in on the publicity push himself, with his own informational #OzempicWeightLoss TikToks reeling in hundreds of thousands of views. The world’s wealthiest individual, Elon Musk, has also praised the drug, publicly and unabashedly. Ozempic is also advertised regularly on TV: the ubiquitous commercials feature various characters who, having stabilized their blood sugar levels, are living healthy, active lives. “Oh!” they exclaim, turning to the camera, barely containing their excitement, as the soundtrack – set to the earwormy melody of Magic, the breakout 1974 single by Scottish soft-rockers Pilot – crescendos. Oh! Oh! Oh! Ozeeeeempic! But the ad mentions weight loss only as an afterthought. In the motormouth recitation of precautions and potential side effects that underscore pharmaceutical ads, the voiceover says off-handedly “You may lose weight!” to which a chipper character responds, “Oh!” That’s because Ozempic is not being marketed as a weight loss drug. It’s sold as a diabetes medication. It’s gained traction in the medical community for its ability to lower blood sugar, or rein in levels of glycated hemoglobin (also known as A1C), often transforming the lives of patients. One of its corollary effects however, is that it makes patients want to eat less. And so doctors are increasingly prescribing the drug off-label, purely for its effect helping people lose weight. Trish Wheeler is one of thousands of Ozempic users. For years, she had exercised and eaten right. She’d even been profiled in a fitness magazine. But as she got a little older, and her body transitioned into menopause, she found her usual habits were no longer doing the trick. “Dieting was not working,” Wheeler, 53, says, “and my joints were hurting enough that I couldn’t strenuously exercise anymore”. When the pandemic hit, the situation got even worse and, as Wheeler puts it, “the weight just piled on”. She managed to lose about 20lbs (9kg) before her doctor prescribed a new treatment: Ozempic. The treatment has seen drastic changes in Wheeler’s life: fatigue, dizziness and an elevated heart rate. She says her brain is “running really, really slowly these days”, which makes phone calls and Zooms a little challenging. But she’s lost weight: a reported 47lbs more (21kg) . “Whether due to age or health,” Wheeler says, “traditional methods for weight loss can become less effective, and so far this drug has done a miraculous job overcoming those obstacles”. But Ozempic is not a miracle. The drug works because Semaglutide simulates a hormone called GLP-1 that regulates blood sugar levels. If blood sugar rises, the hormone tells the body to produce more insulin, which lowers blood sugar levels in turn. This method of action has made GLP-1 a game changer in the management of type 2 diabetes, but the same hormone has also been shown to slow down the passage of food from the stomach to the small intestine, which can increase a feeling of satiety by making patients feel fuller faster. According to data from the Mayo Clinic, studies found that patients combining weekly Semaglutide injections with healthy lifestyle changes (eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly and so on) resulted in weight loss of about 33.7lbs (15kg) in a 68-week period. The drug’s popularity, combined with its promised results, has led to a massive run on supplies globally. The worry is that the off-label use of Ozempic for weight loss is creating shortages for people who rely on the drug in treating type 2 diabetes. *** Isabelle Kenyon is a founder and CEO of Calibrate, a telehealth weight loss startup that has more than 25,000 members, all of whom are using GLP-1s, including Semaglutide, for weight management. “That’s a bad headline,” she protests when I mention a potential Semaglutide shortage. “There is no chance,” she insists, “that the use of these medications, on or off-label, is impacting the availability of these medications for diabetes”. While Kenyon vehemently maintains that the increased usage isn’t resulting in shortages, or in diabetics being unable to access medicine, federal agencies don’t agree. They have been fretting about a Semaglutide scarcity for the past few months. In the spring, Ozempic’s manufacturer, the Danish pharmaceutical giant Novo Nordisk, reported difficulty keeping up with the skyrocketing demand. In Australia, recommendations were made to physicians, who were instructed to prioritize Ozempic’s use in the on-label treatment of type 2 diabetes. As Australian authorities noted, “The shortage is significantly affecting people using Ozempic for its approved use.” The US food and drug administration is sounding a similar alarm, noting that “intermittent supply disruptions” of certain quantities of Semaglutide injectables (the 0.25mg/0.5mg doses, and larger 2mg dose) are attributable to a “demand increase for the drug”. Online, some doctors say the drug is on back order through December. Novo Nordisk responded to the uptick in off-label prescribing by introducing a new, rebranded drug, called Wegovy: a chemically identical Semaglutide injection, offered at higher doses, targeted specifically for obesity and weight management. Now, Wegovy itself is in short supply. The FDA reports that the distribution of Wegovy, in various dosages, has been temporarily paused. Wegovy’s manufacturer stopped shipments of the two smaller, starter dose strengths until their manufacturing and supply chains are able to keep pace with demand. This pause comes at what is, arguably, an opportune time. Between the media hype, the TikTok trends, the targeted ads and the wall-to-wall blitz of TV commercials, GLP-1s seem to have exploded overnight. And while seemingly benign, the drug’s method of action – regulating blood sugar levels and promoting satiety – comes with some peculiar side effects. Four bites of dinner and you’ve had enough For their part, Calibrate advertises their system as a “metabolic reset … We are talking about the combination of medication and lifestyle intervention,” Kenyon explains, “to help you fundamentally reset your metabolic system in a way that sets your body up for long-term, sustained weight loss”. “When you change your body’s insulin reaction,” Kenyon says, “you crave different food. That’s what’s happening.” As a result of this hormonal hot-wiring, certain food cravings basically vanish. The treatment is not merely mechanical, but physiological.

But just as weight loss was initially a byproduct of using GLP-1s for diabetes treatment, these side effects may not be side effects at all, but the cause of the weight loss. Simply put, Ozempic, and similar GLP-1s, may work because they make food (or at least certain types of food) taste disgusting. A 2012 paper in the journal Neuropharmacology found that this feeling of nausea was integral to reducing food take. “Whether food intake suppression,” the authors wrote, “occurs independently of nausea is unknown”.

Naltrexone, an opioid antagonist prescribed to treat alcoholism, has been shown to “reduce the palatability of alcohol”, essentially making booze taste bad (or worse). The antidepressant Wellbutrin has also been long-prized for its off-label ability to make cigarettes taste disgusting, a side effect that resulted in the same chemical (bupropion) being rebranded as Zyban, an FDA-approved smoking cessation aid. For Semaglutide’s true believers like Ghiyam, there’s nothing especially ominous about the treatments. “You can still enjoy [your favorite foods],” he says. “But you enjoy four bites, fives bites, and you’re good.” Ghiyam also stresses that these spells of intense aversion will pass in time, as patients are “trained” to eat healthier foods. In due course of treatment, the desire or stimulus itself is exterminated – “beyond the zero”, as Pavlov famously put it in his 1927 lecture on the conditioned reflexes of dogs.

Culturally, such treatments can still seem like a shortcut, or chemical cheat code. Nobody goes on Oprah to brag about getting liposuction, or having their stomach stapled, or injecting themselves weekly with 2mg of prescription glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. While aspiring TikTok tastemakers may get plenty of views broadcasting their “Ozempic journey”, higher-ups in the influencer economy remain tight-lipped. “Some people just don’t want to talk about it,” says Ghiyam. “It’s the same reason somebody doesn’t tell you when they had a facelift or had any other work done. ‘No! I just look 30 years younger naturally, all of a sudden! I never had botox!’ They don’t want people to think that.” Singers, actors and reality TV stars celebrated for their miraculous body transformations who may be taking the injections may well never cop to it. But for regular users who aren’t subject to tabloid scrutiny, Ozempic is nothing to be ashamed about. “I tell everyone who asks about my weight loss how it was accomplished,” says Trish Wheeler. “No one has acted as if they thought I was cheating. They mostly want to know where they can line up and get some for themselves.” • This article was amended on 11 November 2022 to remove an item of video content.","charCount":"16117","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/john-semley\">John Semley</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/lifestyle","pillarName":"Lifestyle"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/08/kari-lake-arizona-governor-candidate-media-worst-fricking-nightmare","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-09T02:14:25Z","webTitle":"Arizona’s Kari Lake vows to be media’s ‘worst fricking nightmare’ if she wins","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/kari-lake-arizona-governor-candidate-media-worst-fricking-nightmare","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/kari-lake-arizona-governor-candidate-media-worst-fricking-nightmare","fields":{"headline":"Arizona’s Kari Lake vows to be media’s ‘worst fricking nightmare’ if she wins","standfirst":"<p>The gubernatorial candidate has mirrored Trump in attacking the mainstream media despite having thrived as a career anchor</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ng-interactive/2022/nov/08/midterm-election-results-live-2022-map-us-midterms-latest-winners-seats-congress\">US midterm election results 2022: live</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2022/nov/10/midterm-elections-2022-results-senate-house-us-democrats-republicans-live-updates-latest-news\">Midterm elections 2022 – latest results and updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Lake has mirrored Trump in attacking the mainstream media despite having thrived within it as a career anchor","byline":"Martin Pengelly in New York","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9b5557ceef66fb8fef4e1839e7e0762ab5911de4\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9b5557ceef66fb8fef4e1839e7e0762ab5911de4/0_191_3600_2160/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Kari Lake, Arizona Republican candidate for governor, waves to the media as she walks into a voting precinct.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Kari Lake, Arizona Republican candidate for governor, waves to the media as she walks into a voting precinct.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ross D Franklin/AP</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The Trump-aligned Republican candidate for governor in Arizona, Kari Lake, told reporters on Tuesday she would be their “worst fricking nightmare for eight years” if she defeated the Democrat Katie Hobbs for the job.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/kari-lake-trump-arizona-maga-republicanism-midterms\">‘A really dangerous candidate’: Kari Lake, the new face of Maga Republicanism</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Lake has been <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/03/kari-lake-trump-arizona-maga-republicanism-midterms\">talked up</a> as a running mate for Donald Trump in his widely expected run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, which he has indicated he will announce this month.</p> <p>Asked about the prospect on Tuesday, the former TV anchor <a href=\"https://www.mediaite.com/tv/kari-lake-delivers-ominous-warning-to-reporters-at-press-conference-im-going-to-be-your-worst-freaking-nightmare/\">said</a>: “We have talked about this before.

There are still discussions ongoing so I can’t get into that sort of speculation at this stage.</p> </blockquote> <p>One of the reports on the imminent deal is by <strong>Matt Dathan</strong> <a href=\"https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/rishi-sunak-small-boats-migrant-crisis-macron-cop27-bf6bpn93h\">in the Times.</a> He says:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Britain and France are in the “final stages” of agreeing a deal worth about £80 million that will lead to UK immigration officials being stationed in French control rooms for the first time.</p> <p>The agreement is expected to pay for an increase in the 800 daily patrols that at present are carried out by French officers, as well as extra surveillance equipment to detect boats before they enter the water …</p> <p>In what the government hopes will be a crucial breakthrough, the new deal is expected to allow Border Force staff to be stationed alongside their French counterparts in control rooms. It will mean British officers will receive live intelligence on people-smuggling activity and migrant movements in northern France for the first time, rather than relying on information being passed on under the existing limited intelligence-sharing deal.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Rishi Sunak wants the UK and its allies to use the forthcoming G20 summit to “confront” Vladimir Putin or any Russian representative who attends, the PM’s spokesperson said. </strong>Asked if Sunak would sit down with Putin if he did attend, the spokesperson said that was a hypothetical question, because Putin has not said yet if he is attending.

In an interview with Matt Chorley on Times Radio, Kinnock said that most EU countries use ID cards. It is argued that the absence of ID cars in the UK is a pull factor for migrants, because it makes it much easier for them to work illegally in the black economy than it would be in Europe.</p> <p>The last Labour government proposed introducing a national ID card system, but the idea attracted considerable opposition because of concerns about civil liberties and only a limited scheme for foreign nationals came into effect. After 2010 it was scrapped by the coalition government. But Kinnock said he thought those problems could be addressed. He said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>It can’t be beyond the wit of man to look at this and put a system in place that both addresses the issues around civil liberties, but also make sure that we know who is living in our country, and how many people are living in our country.</p> <p>And that will just be so helpful in terms of giving people the reassurance that they’re looking for, that we have control of our borders, and that we don’t have the complete and utter shambles and incompetence and cruelty frankly, that defines the current government.</p> </blockquote> <p>Kinnock also said that one of the problems with the scheme proposed by the last Labour government was that it would have included too much information on ID cards. He said having a “very basic” form of ID card would be more acceptable to people.</p> <p>Tony Blair was prime minister when Labour floated the ID card plan and his thinktank, the <strong>Tony Blair Institute for Global Change,</strong> published <a href=\"https://institute.global/policy/fixing-asylum-system-workable-plan\">a report last week </a>suggesting ID cards should be part of a plan for reforming the asylum system. “The lack of an identity verification scheme and the diminished capacity to return those with invalid cases to other countries means there remains a strong incentive for asylum seekers to try their luck in order to then ‘disappear’ into the black economy,” it said.</p> <p>But <strong>Yvette Cooper,</strong> the shadow home secretary and Kinnock’s boss, dismissed the idea when she was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. Asked if Labour was considering ID cards, she said the problem was not the lack of ID cards, but the lack of employment enforcement. She went on:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>So we would have stronger employment enforcement and proper standards in place, as well as the stronger action to crack down on the criminal gangs.</p> </blockquote> <p><em>UPDATE:</em> I have amended the post above to say that, although the last Labour government failed to roll out a national ID card scheme, it did introduce a limited scheme for foreign nationals (which was subsequently scrapped).</p> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T12:59:44.249Z\">at 12.59pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636a3ae88f08c994120f0413\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T11:20:39.635Z\">11.20am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Sima Kotecha</strong>, Newsnight’s UK editor, has spoken to Tory MPs who are not surprised about the allegations about Sir Gavin Williamson being a bully. </p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/sima_kotecha/status/1589927342688067584\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">One tory MP’s voice trembles with rage as he tells me “Williamson is a nasty b****** and knows where the skeletons are buried.

Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief, is credited with devising a rule saying that, if a scandal continues to dominate the news for more than a certain number of days, the minister involved in it has to go. No one is quite sure what the exact number of days is (13, 11, a week? <a href=\"https://www.newstatesman.com/uncategorized/2010/09/story-campbell-remember\">Campbell himself has forgotten)</a>, but the basic principle is sound, and that should be very worrying for Sir Gavin Williamson, the beleaguered Cabinet Office minister. On Friday last week Cat Neilan from Tortoise revealed that Wendy Morton, the former chief whip, had submitted a complaint to CCHQ about Williamson. The story has now reached day five and, far from going away, it’s snowballing. Here are the key developments this morning.</p> <ul> <li><p><strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/07/senior-civil-servant-claims-gavin-williamson-told-them-slit-your-throat\">A senior civil servant claims Gavin Williamson told them to “slit your throat”</a> </strong>in what they felt was a sustained campaign of bullying while he was defence secretary, my colleague Pippa Crerar has revealed.</p></li> </ul> <ul> <li><p><strong>Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has described the language used by Williamson in these incidents as “just horrible”.</strong> In an interview with the Today programme, she also pointed out that, despite issuing a generalised denial, Williamson is not denying using the language quoted in Pippa’s report. Cooper said:</p></li> </ul> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>He doesn’t deny using the language. The language is horrible and you can’t imagine people being treated like that at work.</p> <p>Gavin Williamson was reappointed to the cabinet even when Rishi Sunak knew there was a new complaint in against him. He has admitted that the language, even in the previous complaint, was unacceptable.</p> <p>Bear in mind he has also appointed him to the Cabinet Office, which supports the National Security Council – even though Gavin Williamson was previously sacked by Theresa May for leaking from the National Security Council.</p> <p>We have also got this other case where Rishi Sunak reappointed Suella Braverman just six days after she was effectively sacked for breaching the ministerial code and security lapses, and where further information and allegations have also come to light since then of security lapses and the leak investigation as well.</p> <p>You have got this lack of proper standards, a lack of ethics. We have still not got an ethics adviser appointed and [the Tories are] also not taking security issues seriously.</p> </blockquote> <ul> <li><p><strong>Morton has referred her complaint about Williamson to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, the parliamentary scheme set up to consider bullying allegations against MPs. </strong>Previously she complained to CCHQ. This development is serious for Williamson because ICGS investigations are particularly rigorous and impartial, whereas CCHQ investigations are less independent, and more opaque. The ICGS can also recommend the suspension of an MP as punishment.

Williamson’s letter, released on his Twitter account, says he refutes “the characterisation of these claims” regarding the further allegations, but added “I recognise these are becoming a distraction for the good work this government is doing”.The former Cabinet Office minister said he had decided to “step back from government” while the complaints process into his conduct is carried out, vowing to “clear my name of any wrongdoing”. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is a damning reflection of a weak Prime Minister. “Rishi Sunak appointed Gavin Williamson with full knowledge of serious allegations about his conduct and repeatedly expressed confidence in him.” A former senior civil servant who claimed Gavin Williamson told them to “slit your throat” has made a formal complaint against him. The allegations were first reported in the Guardian on Monday and included claims that Williamson, who was the defence secretary at the time, told the official on another occasion to “jump out of the window”. Anne Milton, the former deputy chief whip Anne Milton who worked closely with Gavin Williamson when he was chief whip, claimed he used “leverage” and threats to control MPs and instil a culture of fear in Westminster. The Conservative MP Mark Francois said that when he used the word “Japs” in the Commons yesterday, he did not mean to cause offence, and was just trying to shorten a lengthy question. Downing Street said Rishi Sunak is not going to block Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list after Labour has argued he should. Downing Street refused to deny reports that the UK is close to agreeing a £80m deal with France that would involve British immigration officials being stationed in French control rooms to help tackle small boat Channel crossings. Rishi Sunak wants the UK and its allies to use the forthcoming G20 summit to “confront” Vladimir Putin or any Russian representative who attends, the PM’s spokesperson said. Government researchers have found another 1,400 laws that will be wiped off the statute books next year by Brexit legislation tabled by Jacob Rees-Mogg in September. Matt Hancock has said “people will see me warts and all” and gain a perspective on the “human side of the guy behind the podium” ahead of his first full appearance on I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! on Wednesday. Hancock said: “When I’m in camp, people will just see the real me. Survival in the jungle is a good metaphor for the world I work in. “People will see me warts and all. See the human side of the guy behind the podium. I don’t think I’ve got any fears or phobias, but I’m about to find out.” The MP for West Suffolk’s decision to appear in the show has been criticised by the prime minister, Rishi Sunak, who said he was “very disappointed” in the former health secretary. It resulted in Hancock losing the Tory whip. Here are some further comments from Dave Penman on BBC’s Newsnight about the investigation into alleged bullying by Williamson. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA union - which represents senior public servants - said: “Gavin Williamson’s resignation might take some of the political pressure off the prime minister, but it mustn’t be a get out of jail free card. “The allegations against him must still be investigated, and if substantiated, there must be consequences for any future appointment.” Wednesday’s Guardian front page. Here is a roundup of some of Wednesday’s front pages starting with the i: Gavin Williamson said he would not be taking severance pay after resigning from the government. “To dispel any speculation, I want to make it clear that I will not be taking any severance,” he said. “This is taxpayers’ money and it should go instead toward the government’s priorities like reducing the NHS’s waiting lists.” Rishi Sunak knew his premiership would be bound for a rocky start, but the embarrassing defenestration of one of his close cabinet allies after just two weeks threatens to reopen bitter divisions in the Conservative party. Despite initial attempts to resist sacking Gavin Williamson after a slew of bullying allegations, the prime minister was forced on Tuesday to accept his resignation – not because of any admission of wrongdoing, but because it was becoming a “distraction”. The official explanation for Williamson’s departure allows him to leave with slightly better grace than being sacked from cabinet for the third time, and lets the prime minister keep his own hands clean. Labour deputy leader Angela Rayner said: “This is a damning reflection of a weak Prime Minister. “Rishi Sunak appointed Gavin Williamson with full knowledge of serious allegations about his conduct and repeatedly expressed confidence in him. “This is yet another example of Rishi Sunak’s poor judgment and weak leadership. It is clear that he is trapped by the grubby backroom deals he made to dodge a vote, and is incapable of putting country before party. “As families struggle during a cost-of-living crisis made in Downing Street, yet another Tory government has descended into chaos.” Accepting Sir Gavin Williamson’s resignation “with great sadness”, prime minister Rishi Sunak said: “I would like to thank you for your personal support and loyalty.” The SNP’s deputy leader at Westminster Kirsten Oswald said: “Rishi Sunak promised integrity, professionalism and accountability at the heart of his Government - all of which has been trashed within weeks of taking office. “The fact that Gavin Williamson was allowed to resign after a litany of scandals, rather than be sacked, speaks volumes of how toxic and broken this Tory Government is. “As the Westminster chaos continues to unfurl, there can be no doubt that independence is the only way to escape this dysfunctional system for good.” Lib Dem MP Daisy Cooper has said in response to Gavin Williamson’s resignation, “This should be the third and final time Gavin Williamson is forced out of the Cabinet.” Williamson’s letter, released on his Twitter account, says he refutes “the characterisation of these claims” regarding the further allegations of bullying that have been made. But Williamson added in his resignation letter “I recognise these are becoming a distraction for the good work this government is doing”. The former Cabinet Office minister said he had decided to “step back from government” while the complaints process into his conduct is carried out, vowing to “clear my name of any wrongdoing”. Gavin Williamson has announced he is resigning. Boris Johnson has nominated his fiercest cheerleaders for peerages, with two of his former aides set to become the youngest life peers in history. The former prime minister has selected more than a dozen of his closest allies to head to the Lords, as part of a resignations list longer than David Cameron’s and Theresa May’s combined. Here are some of the key figures. A former senior civil servant who claimed Sir Gavin Williamson told them to “slit your throat” has made a formal complaint against him. The allegations were first reported in the Guardian on Monday and included claims that Williamson, who was the defence secretary at the time, told the official on another occasion to “jump out of the window”. The Ministry of Defence official claimed his behaviour amounted to a sustained campaign of bullying. The official, who later left government, said Williamson “deliberately demeaned and intimidated” them on a regular basis. The former civil servant told Sky News his “words and actions had an extreme impact on my mental health”. Williamson, who ran the department between November 2017 until May 2019, said: “I strongly reject this allegation and have enjoyed good working relationships with the many brilliant officials I have worked with across government. “No specific allegations have ever been brought to my attention.” From the Guardian’s Aubrey Allegretti. The next phase of a high-stakes inquiry into whether Boris Johnson misled parliament over Partygate faces being delayed as a result of government failures to provide crucial evidence to MPs, sources have told the Guardian. Despite a range of documents – including the former prime minister’s diaries, event email invites, No 10 entry logs, briefing papers and WhatsApp messages – being requested more than three months ago, some have not been handed over yet. The former Ministry of Defence official who claims they were bullied by Gavin Williamson has now complained to parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, putting more pressure on Rishi Sunak over his decision to reappoint his ally, the Guardian can reveal, write Pippa Crerar and Rowena Mason. In a statement, the complainant said they had an “incredibly difficult period” working for Williamson at the MoD and that the alleged bullying had taken “an extreme impact” on their mental health. In a separate development, two further sources who spoke to the Guardian claimed that during his time as chief whip Williamson had been heard joking or boasting about the effect his tactics had on the mental health of those he worked with, with one saying it had “made people uncomfortable”. Williamson, whose political future is now hanging in the balance, is now facing three separate inquiries into his behaviour, two with the ICGS and the other an internal Conservative party investigation. Two relate to the same incident involving the former chief whip Wendy Morton. Ireland’s taoiseach (prime minister) has warned that if the current generation does not urgently step up to act on climate change, future generations will “not forgive us”. Micheál Martin told the Cop27 climate summit in Egypt that Ireland was doing all it can to reach its climate targets. Giving Ireland’s national climate statement at the c summit in Sharm El-Sheikh, Martin said that as political leaders, it was their responsibility to drive the transformation necessary. “What were once exceptional events are now occurring with increased frequency and ferocity. “People in the poorest parts on the planet are being driven from regions that can no longer support and sustain them. “Climate change is fuelling conflict, global instability, competition for resources and abject human misery. “If this generation doesn’t step up urgently, future generations will not forgive us.” Labour MP Sarah Owen, the first MP of south-east Asian heritage, has said she does not accept Mark Francois’s explanation for using the term “Japs” during proceedings in the Commons on Monday. Francois said he “meant absolutely no disrespect or offence to anyone” by using the term and that he “merely used it as an abbreviation for Japanese”. He said he had been asking an “admittedly rather wordy question, about naval shipbuilding” and “actually complimented the Japanese shipbuilding industry for building warships much faster than here in Britain”. Owen said Francois should have just said “Japanese”. She told Sky News: “We all know what he really meant. ‘Japs’ has a long history of being derogatory and should be avoided, in the same way we say ‘Pakistanis’ and ‘Chinese’, rather than short terms which have offensive connotations.” A Plaid Cymru Senedd member has been suspended from his party’s group over allegations he breached the parliament’s code of conduct. The party said Rhys ab Owen had been temporarily suspended pending the conclusion of an investigation by the Senedd standards commissioner. Owen, a barrister, was first elected to represent the South Wales Central region in 2021. A Plaid Cymru Senedd group spokesman said: “Rhys ab Owen MS, Plaid Cymru member of the Senedd for South Wales Central, and the Plaid Cymru group in the Senedd, have mutually agreed to his temporary suspension from the Plaid Cymru group. “This is a neutral act, without prejudice, pending the conclusion of an investigation by the Senedd standards commissioner into an alleged breach of the code of conduct for members of the Senedd.” Anne Milton has also accused Sir Gavin Williamson of behaving in an “unethical and immoral” way as chief whip. Milton, who lost the Tory whip during the Brexit rows in 2019 and subsequently lost her seat, told Channel 4 News: “I got the impression that he loved salacious gossip, and would use it as leverage against MPs if the need arose.” She also told the broadcaster that Williamson had an expletive-filled rant about civil servants in 2016 in response to a female official asking why a minister had to change travel plans for a vote. “Always tell them to f*** off and if they have the bollocks to come and see me,” he said in an email, according to Ms Milton. “F****** jumped up civil servants.” Anne Milton, the former deputy chief whip Anne Milton who worked closely with Sir Gavin Williamson when he was chief whip, has claimed he used “leverage” and threats to control MPs and instil a culture of fear in Westminster. Milton told Channel 4 News of an alleged incident, when she says that the whips’ office gave some financial assistance to an MP: “I do remember him asking me to give the MP in question the cheque. And he waved it under my nose and said: ‘Make sure when you give him this cheque, he knows I now own him.’” Milton said: “I don’t think it was a joke. It was the seriousness with which he said it. And I think that the bottom line is, if instances accord with your overall experience with somebody, then you believe them.” She added that she gave the MP the cheque but didn’t pass on Williamson’s message. Milton alleges Williamson behaved in an “unethical and immoral” and “shocking” manner during his time as chief whip between July 2016 and November 2017. She also accused Williamson of using MPs’ mental and physical health problems as “leverage”. Milton describes Williamson’s behaviour while chief whip as “threatening” and “intimidating”. She added: “It’s an image he cultivates. I think he feels that he’s Francis Urquhart from House of Cards.” Four Conservative MPs who were loyal to Boris Johnson and have been nominated for peerages have agreed to delay accepting them to avoid triggering byelections, writes Aletha Adu and Peter Walker. Rishi Sunak is facing pressure to block the former PM’s “conveyor belt of cronies” after Johnson told Tory MPs to hold back on heading to the Lords until the end of the current parliament so the party doesn’t face a number of potentially difficult election challenges. The ultra-loyal Nadine Dorries, the former culture secretary; Alok Sharma, the Cop26 president; Alister Jack, the Scottish secretary, and Nigel Adams are set to be on Johnson’s resignation list. After it emerged that British immigration officers could be stationed in French control rooms for the first time under a new deal to curb Channel crossings, the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride, hailed the “fundamental shift” in the tone of relations between Britain and France as officials thrashed out the final details of the deal. He told Sky News: “The mood music seems to be good at the moment. “My understanding is we’re in the final stages of what could be an agreement, which would be very good news. “I think there has been a fundamental shift in the tone between ourselves and the French.” The government said the fresh agreement between the UK and France, understood to be worth about £80m, is in its final stages. An additional £5m of funding to tackle loss and damage has been announced by the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, at the Cop27 climate summit. The funds take Scotland’s commitment to addressing loss and damage caused by the climate crisis to £7m and will enable communities to take direct action to address the impacts of loss and damage. The government said this includes slow-onset effects such as sea level rise and non-economic effects including the loss of cultural identity. It will also help to tackle existing inequalities, including gender inequalities, which are exacerbated by the effects of climate change. The crisis at the Manston processing centre for refugees in Kent is not yet over, Dame Diana Johnson, the chair of the Commons home affairs committee has said. In a statement released after her committee visited the centre today, Johnson, a Labour MP, said: What the home affairs committee saw at Manston revealed that while overcrowding has reduced, and staff are making valiant efforts to improve conditions for detainees, the crisis is not over. We encountered families who had been sleeping on mats on the floor for weeks. Meanwhile there are ongoing questions about the legality of the home secretary’s decision to detain people at the site for longer than 24 hours. The Home Office has been running to keep up with this escalating crisis, rather than warding it off at the outset through planning and preparation. The numbers of people crossing the Channel in small boats this year will not have been a surprise to the government, so why were adequate preparations not made? This question matters – because we may still see another major upsurge in the number of people arriving at Manston before the end of this year. The home secretary needs to end this crisis once and for all. That requires dealing with the backlog in the asylum system and establishing a system that is efficient and fair. That is all from me for today. My colleague Nadeem Badshah is now taking over. Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, has criticised Rishi Sunak’s decision to give Sir Gavin Williamson ministerial responsibilities relating to communications and security. According to the Cabinet Office, Williamson’s responsibilities will include the Government Communications Service and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). The CSSF is a cross-government initiative that funds projects that contribute to national security – normally peace-keeping operations abroad, in places where instability could pose a threat to other countries. Rayner said: Gavin Williamson has not only been given a vote of confidence by the prime minister but handed crucial national security and government communications responsibilities, despite having previously been sacked from cabinet of leaking details of a national security council meeting. After a week of appalling allegations about intimidatory behaviour towards colleagues, the prime minister has rewarded Williamson by giving him authority over huge swathes of the civil service. The fact Rishi Sunak appointed him and then promoted him shows a weak prime minister who puts party management before the national interest. The Conservative MP Mark Francois has said that, when he used the word “Japs” in the Commons yesterday, he did not mean to cause offence, and was just trying to shorten a lengthy question. In a statement responding to criticism of what he said from Labour (see 2.27pm), Francois also said he was complimenting the Japanese. He said: I meant absolutely no disrespect or offence to anyone by using the phrase ‘Japs’ during defence questions in the House of Commons yesterday. I merely used it as an abbreviation for Japanese as I had, by then, been asking an admittedly rather wordy question, about naval shipbuilding. Moreover, in the course of that same question, as the record clearly shows, I actually complimented the Japanese shipbuilding industry for building warships much faster than here in Britain. Yvette Cooper intervenes. She asks if Quin has seen the conclusions of the leak inquiries involving Suella Braverman when she was attorney general. And did the PM see those before he appointed her? Quin says successive governments have not commented on leak inquiries. And the fact that a minister is considered by a leak inquiry does not mean they are at fault, he says. He says it just means they had access to the information that was leaked. He says, if Labour’s motion were to pass, it would set a damaging precedent for the future. Jeremy Quin, the Cabinet Office minister, is responding to Yvette Cooper on behalf of the government. He says MPs should be debating more important matters, like the improvement in conditions at the Manston processing centre for migrants. He says Suella Braverman set out in detail what led up to her resignation in the open letter she released. The prime minister considered the matter was closed, and brought her back, he says. Dame Meg Hillier says what matters is Braverman’s judgment. And her judgment has not improved after her six-day resignation. Quin says Braverman recognises that she made an error. She apologised, and the mistake will not be repeated, he says. Back in the Commons, Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, says a series of Tory prime ministers have not taken security seriously. And if Rishi Sunak is taking this seriously, the government should publish the papers requested by the motion, so MPs can see. She goes on: [Sunak has] only been post two weeks and already we’ve got this chaos in place. He said he wants to stand up for integrity – so enforce the ministerial code. He said he wants professionalism – so appoint people who can do the job. And he said he wants accountability – so support this motion and show some accountability to the house. Downing Street has said Rishi Sunak is not going to block Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list, as Labour has argued he should. (See 3.34pm.) Asked if Sunak would block the peerages proposed by Johnson, the PM’s spokesperson replied: There’s a longstanding convention that prime ministers do not seek to intervene in former prime ministers’ resignation honours lists. That’s been a case under successive governments. The prime minister is of the view that he will approach it as has been the case of successive governments. Cooper says Braverman broke the ministerial code when she was home secretary. This was admitted in her account of her resignation. But she may have also have broken the ministerial code by ignoring legal advice, she says. She says only yesterday Grant Shapps said the Home Office was close to acting illegally when he replaced her. Gary Sambrook (Con) intervenes, and says Labour MPs supported making Jeremy Corbyn prime minister, even though he did not trust what the security services were saying regarding the Salisbury poisonings. In response, Cooper says she was a backbencher at the time, and disagreed with Corbyn’s stance on that. She says Sambrook should be more worried about Boris Johnson, who attended a party where he met a former KGB officer, without his officials, when he was foreign secretary. Cooper says Suella Braverman was involved in leak inquiries when she was attorney general. One of those leaks was quoted against the government in court, making it harder for the goverment to make its case, Cooper says. She says Braverman should take standards seriously. If the PM has confidence in the home secretary not to be careless with security, he should release the facts, she says. She says she wants to know what information Rishi Sunak had about Braverman before he reappointed her. Was he advised not to reappoint her on security grounds? If Sunak was told it was safe to reappoint her he should provide the evidence, she says. But if he was advised not to reappoint her, people should know. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, is now opening the debate on the Labour motion that would force the government to publish government papers relating to the decision to reappoint Braverman as home secretary, and any security breaches or leak inquiries she was involved in. She starts by listing some of the allegations against Braverman. But, as she makes the point that what has happened has undermined the government’s reputation for integrity, she also refers to Gavin Williamson getting a job despite having told an official to “slit your throat”. She says outside the Tory party people find it hard to understand why Braverman was reappointed home secretary less than a week after having to resign. At the afternoon lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson said that Rishi Sunak intends to wait until all the inquiries into Gavin Williamson are complete before deciding whether he should keep his job – but he did not rule out acting soon. There are now three inquiries underway: a CCHQ one into the complaint from Wendy Morton; a parliamentary one into the same allegations; and a No 10 inquiry of some sort into the revelations in the Guardian today about Williamson telling an MoD official to “slit your throat”. Asked when the PM might respond, the spokesperson indicated that although he was minded to wait until the external inquiries were concluded, he could act earlier. The spokesperson said: I don’t think he necessarily feels that the idea would be for him to wait until both of those things [the CCHQ inquiry and the parliamentary inquiry] have fully concluded. Obviously he would act if and when he felt it appropriate to do so. Five MPs are standing in the election for a new chair for the Commons Treasury committee. The previous chair, Mel Stride, has been made work and pensions secretary, and the post is open only to Conservative MPs. Nominations closed today and the five candidates are: Harriett Baldwin, John Baron, Richard Fuller, Andrea Leadsom, and Kit Malthouse. The ballot will take place tomorrow, with all MPs entitled to vote between 11am and 2.30pm. The Cabinet Office has finally published the list of Sir Gavin Williamson’s ministerial responsibilities (or the portfolio for the minister without portfolio), and it appears that he will be overseeing all government spin doctors. That is because he has responsibility for the Government Communications Service. He is also responsible for: the GREAT campaign, the Geospatial Commission, the Office of Government Property, the Government Property Agency, the Places for Growth strategy and the Conflict, Stability and Security Fund (CSSF). The Cabinet Office also says Williamson will be responsible for supporting the Oliver Dowden, the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, “on driving the delivery of [the] government’s priorities”. A group of MPs who sit on the home affairs, women and equalities and human rights parliamentary committees visited the Manston migrant processing centre in Kent after concerns were raised about overcrowding, PA Media reports. Shortly after the delegation left, a man who shouted “help” and claimed he had been at the site for 30 days was seen being pinned up against a fence and dragged away by security guards when he tried to speak to members of the press. Labour is urging Rishi Sunak to block the peerages in Boris Johnson’s resignation honours list (see 10.55am), Dan Bloom reports for the Mirror. He quotes Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, saying Johnson’s plan to give peerages to four Tory MPs who would only take them up after the election amounts to a proposed “conveyor belt of cronies”. Rayner said: This disgraced ex-prime minister’s plot to dodge democracy by trying to reward his MP lackeys with promised jobs for life in the House of Lords yet again puts the Tory party’s interests before the public’s. These underhand attempt to game the system by installing a conveyor belt of cronies and skewing parliament in the Tories’ favour for decades to come should never see the light of day. MPs are currently debating the Labour motion calling on the government to maintain the pensions triple lock in the 2023-24 financial year, and many backbench Tories have been making it clear that they agree that the triple lock should not be abandoned. Opening the debate, Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, claimed that he could not say today what would happen because he had to wait until the autumn statement next week. But he strongly hinted that pensioners would be protected. He told MPs: It’s only right that we are honest with the public and honest in this house about the ramifications of that situation and we are going see on November 17 some very difficult choices brought forward by the chancellor of the exchequer both on tax and spending. This country has to demonstrate that it will live within its means, that it will act fiscally responsibly and as a consequence of that we can see bond yields softening, interest rates softening, which will be good for mortgage holders, good for businesses who are borrowing and good for the servicing costs of the government and its national debt. But within those hard choices, there is a core mission that this government has and that is to look after the most vulnerable ... This government cares about those that have the least and is there to protect them at every turn. Anne McElvoy from the Economist thinks that it is now inevitable that Gavin Williamson will have to go. The Conservative MP Mark Francois has been accused of using a “crass racial slur” about the Japanese in the House of Commons. Sarah Owen, a Labour MP and chair of East Asians and South-East Asians for Labour, used a point of order today to criticise Francois, and other Tories who have used offensive language about Asians. During defence questions in the Commons on Monday Francois asked: Given the defence budget is likely to come under great pressure, why does it take BAE Systems 11 years to build a ship the Japs can build in four? Raising her point of order, Owen said that referring to Japanese people as “Japs” was an “outdated and crass racial slur” that was well below the standard expected in the Commons. Referring to an article in the Sunday Times asking why there are just two MPs of eastern Asian or south-east Asian heritage in the Commons (Owen and the Tory Alan Mak), despite there being 1.2 million people from this group in the country, she went on: Perhaps it is comments like this by [Francois] or ‘the little man in China’ trope trotted out by a government minister last week, or when the former leader of the House [Jacob Rees-Mogg] said the word ‘Yellow Peril’ from that despatch box. Rees-Mogg subsequently apologised for his remarks, saying he did not know that what he had said was racist and that his use of the term was “out of ignorance”. In response Sir Lindsay Hoyle, the Speaker, said “the casual use of racial terms causes upset and should not be used”. Afterwards a Labour party source said: If there was ever any doubt, the nasty party is firmly back. Mark Francois may need reminding that it is 2022, not 1940. He should apologise for this language. UPDATE: Francois later issued a statement saying he did not mean to cause offence. See 5.01pm. The Liberal Democrats are calling for an independent Cabinet Office inquiry into the the report that Sir Gavin Williamson told an official to “slit your throat” and to jump out of a window when he was defence secretary. The Lib Dem MP Christine Jardine said: The Conservatives must not be allowed to mark their own homework. We need an independent inquiry now to address these damning allegations about Gavin Williamson’s conduct. Anything less would be an abdication of leadership from Number 10, and make a mockery of Sunak’s promise to govern with integrity. Downing Street has said that there will be some sort of inquiry into this allegation, but it has not given details of what this will involve. (See 12.18pm, 12.28pm and 12.31pm.) Much of the Downing Street lobby briefing was taken up with questions about Sir Gavin Williamson. But here are the key lines on the other topics that came up. Downing Street refused to deny reports that the UK is close to agreeing a £80m deal with France that would involve British immigration officials being stationed in French control rooms to help tackle small boat Channel crossings. Asked about the reports, the PM’s spokesperson said: I’ve seen obviously a lot of detail this morning speculating on what might be in a future deal. There are still discussions ongoing so I can’t get into that sort of speculation at this stage. One of the reports on the imminent deal is by Matt Dathan in the Times. He says: Britain and France are in the “final stages” of agreeing a deal worth about £80 million that will lead to UK immigration officials being stationed in French control rooms for the first time. The agreement is expected to pay for an increase in the 800 daily patrols that at present are carried out by French officers, as well as extra surveillance equipment to detect boats before they enter the water … In what the government hopes will be a crucial breakthrough, the new deal is expected to allow Border Force staff to be stationed alongside their French counterparts in control rooms. It will mean British officers will receive live intelligence on people-smuggling activity and migrant movements in northern France for the first time, rather than relying on information being passed on under the existing limited intelligence-sharing deal. Rishi Sunak wants the UK and its allies to use the forthcoming G20 summit to “confront” Vladimir Putin or any Russian representative who attends, the PM’s spokesperson said. Asked if Sunak would sit down with Putin if he did attend, the spokesperson said that was a hypothetical question, because Putin has not said yet if he is attending. But the spokesperson said: The prime minister is of the view that it would be right that collectively with our allies we confront any Russian official ... who attends the G20 about their ongoing illegal war and use the same messages we have been using in one voice for so many months now. Cabinet agreed that restoring devolved government in Northern Ireland is an “absolute priority”, the spokesperson said. He said Chris Heaton-Harris, the Northern Ireland secretary, will make a statement to MPs on this topic tomorrow. The spokesperson confirmed that the government has no plans to introduce ID cards. (See 11.41am.) And the spokesperson said reform of the House of Lords was not an “immediate priority” for the government. He said: The House of Lords plays an important and valuable role in scrutinising and revising legislation. We are committed to looking at the role of the Lords but it needs to be carefully considered in the round. Further reform is not an immediate priority as we tackle some of the issues that the UK faces. Earlier Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said the Lords should be reformed. (See 10.56am.) Angela Rayner, the deputy Labour leader, says that, in appointing Gavin Williamson and keeping him in office, Rishi Sunak is making an “appalling error of judgment”. At the No 10 lobby briefing it was put to the PM’s spokesperson that, if Rishi Sunak kept Gavin Williamson in office, he would be giving carte blanche to ministers to tell their officials to slit their throats. Not surprisingly, the spokesperson did not accept this. He went on: The prime minister has been clear about the approach that he wants from ministers, and the high standards that they will be held to. I think the public would understand that, in order to achieve that, you need to follow the correct processes before setting out any further action. Yesterday the Cabinet Office said it was not yet able to give details of what Gavin Williamson will be doing in his capacity as a minister without portfolio. No 10 said he would deal with the GREAT Britain &amp; Northern Ireland marketing campaign. Today the PM’s spokesperson identified two more projects that Williamson would be working on. He said that Williamson would be involved in the Places for Growth, a scheme aimed at reducing regional disparities, including by moving civil servants out of London, and in the Geospatial commission, a body that oversees the use of location data. Asked when people would find out the results of the No 10 inquiries into the “slit your throat” allegations about Gavin Williamson, the PM’s spokesperson said: \"We will update in due course.” At the Downing Street lobby briefing the prime minister’s spokesperson was asked to confirm that No 10 would be looking into the allegation that Gavin Williamson told an official to “slit your throat” regardless of whether or not a formal complaint was submitted. The spokesperson implied that was the case. He said: These are serious allegations, they are new allegations, and, before commenting further, we want to take time to consider. The Downing Street lobby briefing has just finished, and it sounds as if Rishi Sunak is not minded to ignore the new revelation about Gavin Williamson telling an official, when he was defence secretary, to “slit your throat”. In response, Williamson issued a statement to the Guardian saying: I strongly reject this allegation and have enjoyed good working relationships with the many brilliant officials I have worked with across government. No specific allegations have ever been brought to my attention. It is understood that Williamson meant by this that he was only rejecting the allegation that he was a bully. He is not denying that he used the words attributed to him, and that is what Downing Street understands his statement to mean, too. At the lobby briefing the PM’s spokesperson said Sunak continued to have full confidence in Williamson. But he went on: Obviously there have been further allegations reported this morning. Those are serious allegations that have come in. It is true that no formal complaint has been made, but we want to consider proper processes before commenting further. At another point the spokesperson said Downing Street would be “checking due process” before commenting further. Asked if the Cabinet Office’s propriety and ethics team would be involved in this, the spokesperson said he would not discuss the process. This is serious for Williamson. No 10 could have just have said: “Williamson has denied this, there has been no formal complaint,” and left it at that. But it hasn’t. Government researchers have found another 1,400 laws that will be wiped off the statute books next year by Brexit legislation tabled by Jacob Rees-Mogg in September, my colleague Lisa O’Carroll reports. Kit Malthouse, the former policing minister, told Times Radio that he would be opposed to the introduction of ID cards as part of asylum system reform. (See 11.41am.) Malthouse said: I would be jumpy about us all having ID cards. It’s not far to jump from that to us all having a barcode tattooed on us at birth. And if the requirement is we have to carry our ID cards at all times, to be able to present them at all times to identify ourselves, it does start to become a little bit heavy handed. I think the solution to the Channel problem lies in a much better deal with the French and I think that that’s what the prime minister will pull off in the weeks to come. Anneliese Dodds, the Labour party chair, says Wendy Morton’s decision to submit her complaint about Gavin Williamson to parliament’s Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme (see 8.50am) shows a lack of confidence in the Conservative party’s own complaints system. She said: The lack of faith in the Conservative party complaints process shows how rotten the culture at the heart of this party goes – and the buck stops with Rishi Sunak. He was warned about Gavin Williamson’s behaviour and appointed him anyway. He has done grubby deal after grubby deal to become prime minister and now must take responsibility and stop putting party management before national interest. Stephen Kinnock, the shadow immigration minister, has said Labour should consider introducing ID cards as one policy that might help to curb the number of people crossing the Channel in small boats. In an interview with Matt Chorley on Times Radio, Kinnock said that most EU countries use ID cards. It is argued that the absence of ID cars in the UK is a pull factor for migrants, because it makes it much easier for them to work illegally in the black economy than it would be in Europe. The last Labour government proposed introducing a national ID card system, but the idea attracted considerable opposition because of concerns about civil liberties and only a limited scheme for foreign nationals came into effect. After 2010 it was scrapped by the coalition government. But Kinnock said he thought those problems could be addressed. He said: It can’t be beyond the wit of man to look at this and put a system in place that both addresses the issues around civil liberties, but also make sure that we know who is living in our country, and how many people are living in our country. And that will just be so helpful in terms of giving people the reassurance that they’re looking for, that we have control of our borders, and that we don’t have the complete and utter shambles and incompetence and cruelty frankly, that defines the current government. Kinnock also said that one of the problems with the scheme proposed by the last Labour government was that it would have included too much information on ID cards. He said having a “very basic” form of ID card would be more acceptable to people. Tony Blair was prime minister when Labour floated the ID card plan and his thinktank, the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change, published a report last week suggesting ID cards should be part of a plan for reforming the asylum system. “The lack of an identity verification scheme and the diminished capacity to return those with invalid cases to other countries means there remains a strong incentive for asylum seekers to try their luck in order to then ‘disappear’ into the black economy,” it said. But Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary and Kinnock’s boss, dismissed the idea when she was interviewed on the Today programme this morning. Asked if Labour was considering ID cards, she said the problem was not the lack of ID cards, but the lack of employment enforcement. She went on: So we would have stronger employment enforcement and proper standards in place, as well as the stronger action to crack down on the criminal gangs. UPDATE: I have amended the post above to say that, although the last Labour government failed to roll out a national ID card scheme, it did introduce a limited scheme for foreign nationals (which was subsequently scrapped). Sima Kotecha, Newsnight’s UK editor, has spoken to Tory MPs who are not surprised about the allegations about Sir Gavin Williamson being a bully. Ian Murray, the shadow Scottish secretary, has said that if Alistair Jack, the Scottish secretary, was confident about defending his record at an election, he would not be getting ready to accept a peerage. Referring to today’s Times story (see 10.55am), Murray said: With Labour ready to replace this rotten Tory government, it’s little wonder that ministers are desperately looking for an escape route. But if Tory politicians had any confidence in their shameful record they would stand in front of the people and defend it in a general election now. A spokesperson for Jack said: We cannot comment on speculation about peerages. Alister Jack is absolutely committed to representing his constituents and working with the prime minister to continue to deliver for people in Scotland. In an interview this morning Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, said the House of Lords should be reformed. He was speaking in response to questions prompted by a story claiming that Boris Johnson wants to include two young political aides on the list of people getting peerages in his resignation honours. Stride told Times Radio: If your question is does the … House of Lords need reform? I think absolutely. Not least to the point you’re making: its size, which has now grown to, I think, over 800 members, which is larger than the Chinese Communist party’s central committee. I do think there is scope for change, but it is one of those things that has been very difficult to get political consensus on. In her Times story Lara Spirit says Johnson has nominated Ross Kempsell, 30, and Charlotte Owen, who is thought to be in her late 20s, for the Lords. Spirit says they would be the youngest people ever to receive life peerages. She says: Kempsell, a former journalist, recently stepped down as the Conservative party’s political director. Owen, who graduated from university in 2015, had been a parliamentary assistant to Sir Jake Berry, the former party chairman, and Johnson before joining the No 10 policy unit last year. She later worked jointly for Liz Truss and Wendy Morton, at that time the chief whip. Spirit says Johnson has nominated around 20 people in total for peerages. She says others on the list include the Tory MPs Nadine Dorries, Alok Sharma, Alister Jack and Nigel Adams; former No 10 aides Dan Rosenfield and Ben Gascoigne; David Ross, the Tory donor and Carphone Warehouse founder who funded a holiday for Johnson and his wife in a luxury villa in Mustique in December 2019; Paul Dacre, the former Daily Mail editor; Ben Houchen, the Tees Valley mayor; and Shaun Bailey, the former Tory mayoral candidate for London. The MPs have reportedly agreed to delay taking their peerages until the end of this parliament, to avoid the need for byelections. Sources close to Johnson did not deny the report, PA Media reports. Asked about the Times story, Stride said it would not be right for him to “start opining on individual appointments”. Labour has demanded a debate in parliament over the government’s failure to publish its clean air and water targets, which put ministers in contravention of the Environment Act. The government was supposed to publish a set of environment targets on 31 October, but admitted it had not had time to respond to the consultation which would determine them. The shadow environment minister, Alex Sobel, said in a letter to the environment secretary, Thérèse Coffey: The government’s failure to abide by the rules it has set itself is not only a dereliction of duty nationally, which is likely to trigger an investigation by the Office of Environmental Protection, but it is also an international embarrassment. Sobel said MPs should be allowed to debate the matter, and that Coffey should reveal what legal advice she had had about the delay, and when the targets would be published. In his interviews this morning Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, hinted strongly that the government will keep the triple lock in place for pensions – which would mean that next year they would rise by 10.1%. When Liz Truss was prime minister she said the government remained committed to the triple lock. Under Rishi Sunak almost every government spending commitment is under review, pending the autumn statement next week, but ministers have said they want to continue to protect vulnerable people. Stride told Times Radio that Sunak has been “extremely clear” that pensioners will be protected. He said: The way the Conservatives in government have always seen pensioners is that they are a group that have particular vulnerabilities. They find it difficult to change their economic circumstances – certainly in the short term, for example, by going back into work, and therefore we have introduced things like the triple lock … So pensioners are absolutely at the forefront of the group that we want to really protect as much as we can through these difficult times. Grant Shapps, the business secretary, has said Sir Gavin Williamson has apologised for sending abusive messages to a colleague. As PA Media reports, Shapps, asked while arriving in Downing Street for cabinet this morning if Williamson was a bully, replied: Not in my experience. Clearly he shouldn’t have sent those [messages], he’s recognised that and he’s apologised about it. Speaking about the “slit your throat” comment, Shapps added: “I don’t think there was a formal complaint, so let’s wait and see what’s said about that.” There have not been many Tories willing to defend Gavin Williamson, but yesterday Nick Timothy, who was co-chief of staff to Theresa May when Williamson was chief whip, put a thread on Twitter praising his political skills and saying Rishi Sunak should keep him. Timothy describes Williamson as “the best chief whip the party has had in decades”. Mel Stride, the work and pensions secretary, drew the Downing Street short straw this morning and was on the airwaves having to defend Sir Gavin Williamson, as well as taking questions on other matters. “Defend” is probably the wrong word, because Stride’s support for his colleague was half-hearted at best, and in key respects he cut him loose. Here are the key points. Stride said it would have been “utterly, utterly unacceptable” if Williamson had told a senior civil servant to “slit your throat” and “jump out of the window”. He told Sky News: If that is the case, that is utterly, utterly unacceptable, but at the moment it is in the realm of media speculation. Williamson has issued a generalised denial in response to the Guardian story, saying that he had good working relations with his officials. But he has not denied using the words attributed to him, described as “utterly, utterly unacceptable” by Stride. Stride confirmed that Williamson’s messages to Wendy Morton were now the subject of a parliamentary investigation. Stride said that a decision about Williamson’s future could be taken once the inquiry was over. He also suggested there could be further inquiries. He said: I think the important thing we do now is not to start intervening … and opining on who’s right and wrong or what may or may not have happened, but to wait for the results of that investigation. And then when we have that, and any other investigation that may be triggered in the meantime, then I think we can take stock and come to a firm conclusion. Stride stressed that no minister was unsackable. Stride said that Williamson, a former chief whip, deserved a seat at the cabinet table because of his understanding of Tory MPs. He told Times Radio: I think Gavin is somebody who … has particular talents and a particular understanding of the parliamentary party. Stride said that he “suspects” Williamson will still be a minister at Christmas. Good morning. Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief, is credited with devising a rule saying that, if a scandal continues to dominate the news for more than a certain number of days, the minister involved in it has to go. No one is quite sure what the exact number of days is (13, 11, a week? Campbell himself has forgotten), but the basic principle is sound, and that should be very worrying for Sir Gavin Williamson, the beleaguered Cabinet Office minister. On Friday last week Cat Neilan from Tortoise revealed that Wendy Morton, the former chief whip, had submitted a complaint to CCHQ about Williamson. The story has now reached day five and, far from going away, it’s snowballing. Here are the key developments this morning. A senior civil servant claims Gavin Williamson told them to “slit your throat” in what they felt was a sustained campaign of bullying while he was defence secretary, my colleague Pippa Crerar has revealed. Yvette Cooper, the shadow home secretary, has described the language used by Williamson in these incidents as “just horrible”. In an interview with the Today programme, she also pointed out that, despite issuing a generalised denial, Williamson is not denying using the language quoted in Pippa’s report. Cooper said: He doesn’t deny using the language. The language is horrible and you can’t imagine people being treated like that at work. Gavin Williamson was reappointed to the cabinet even when Rishi Sunak knew there was a new complaint in against him. He has admitted that the language, even in the previous complaint, was unacceptable. Bear in mind he has also appointed him to the Cabinet Office, which supports the National Security Council – even though Gavin Williamson was previously sacked by Theresa May for leaking from the National Security Council. We have also got this other case where Rishi Sunak reappointed Suella Braverman just six days after she was effectively sacked for breaching the ministerial code and security lapses, and where further information and allegations have also come to light since then of security lapses and the leak investigation as well. You have got this lack of proper standards, a lack of ethics. We have still not got an ethics adviser appointed and [the Tories are] also not taking security issues seriously. Morton has referred her complaint about Williamson to the Independent Complaints and Grievance Scheme, the parliamentary scheme set up to consider bullying allegations against MPs. Previously she complained to CCHQ. This development is serious for Williamson because ICGS investigations are particularly rigorous and impartial, whereas CCHQ investigations are less independent, and more opaque. The ICGS can also recommend the suspension of an MP as punishment. This new development was revealed by the Times’s Steven Swinford. Nicky Morgan, the former education secretary, has said that based on her experience of Williamson when she was in government, she is not surprised by the allegations about him. “Unfortunately Gavin has a reputation, it’s not a very nice one, and I really don’t know why Rishi Sunak felt he had to have him back in government,” she said. Asked if Williamson should be sacked, Morgan also said it would be “very difficult” for Sunak not to demand his resignation. She said it would be better for Williamson to resign first. She made the comments on Talk TV last night. Here is the agenda for the day. Morning: Sunak chairs cabinet. 11.30am: Downing Street holds a lobby briefing. 11.30am: James Cleverly, the foreign secretary, takes questions in the Commons. After 12.30pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion saying the government should maintain the triple lock for the 2023-24 financial year. 1.10pm (UK time): Nicola Sturgeon, Scotland’s first minister, speaks at a panel discussion at Cop27 on loss and damage. Around 4pm: MPs begin a debate on a Labour motion that would force the government to publish government papers relating to the decision to reappoint Braverman as home secretary, and any security breaches or leak inquiries she was involved in. I try to monitor the comments below the line (BTL) but it is impossible to read them all. If you have a direct question, do include “Andrew” in it somewhere and I’m more likely to find it. I do try to answer questions and, if they are of general interest, I will post the question and reply above the line (ATL), although I can’t promise to do this for everyone. If you want to attract my attention quickly, it is probably better to use Twitter. I’m on @AndrewSparrow.

Long overlooked downballot races, there has been an enormous amount of attention on secretary of state races since the 2020 election, when their role in overseeing vote counting came into focus as Donald Trump tried to overturn the election. Michigan is one of several states where the Republican nominee for secretary of state questioned and tried to overturned the results of the 2020 race.</p> \n  <p>Standing outside his polling place, an elementary school, Michigan, Zapor said he voted for <strong>Jocelyn Benson</strong>, a Democrat, who is running for a second term. She leads her opponent <strong>Kristina Karamo</strong>, a community college professor, in the polls.</p> \n  <p>“I think election deniers on the ballot is a very dangerous thing,” Zapor, a 46-year-old mental health counselor said. “When you’re running on a platform of complete abject falsehoods, to me, that shows a complete lack of character. And you’re running for the exact wrong reason.”<br></p> \n  <p>Zapor added that he was concerned that there could be a repeat of efforts to overturn the election, like there were in 2020.</p> \n  <p>“I think it’s a certainty. I’m very concerned. Both in Michigan and in the nation, in 2024, I guess even in this election, will continue to be divisive and to see violence would not surprise me. I really hope I’m wrong, but that’s what I think,” he said.</p> \n  <p>South Lyon is a competitive area in Oakland county, a battleground in Michigan.</p> \n  <p>Another voter, who would only give his middle name, Alex, said he was also deeply concerned about election denialism. </p> \n  <p>“I’m concerned in general that the truth in general has eluded us and many will continue to leverage what happened in 2020 and for false information in general,” he said.</p> \n  <p>Another voter, who would only give his first name, Tom, said he voted for Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, because she was the “lesser of two evils.” He said he also voted for Benson, who sees the state’s motor vehicle offices in addition to elections, because he recently had a quick appointment renewing his driver’s license.</p> \n  <p>“She did what she said he was going to do,” he said.</p> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636aa07d8f083f3e45283627\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/poppy-noor\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T18:38:46.586Z\">6.38pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>In Michigan, students are coming out for Slotkin in Lansing, whether they like her or not.</p> \n  <p>“I don’t like much about Slotkin, but everyone else was worse,” said Kathryne Ford, 26, a biochemistry PHD candidate at Michigan State University outside of the Don Johnson Fieldhouse this morning. Ford called Slotkin a “cop”, with reference to her career as a CIA analyst, but lists abortion restrictions as her top concern this election cycle. “Abortion is a human right.

But not this year.</p> \n  <p>Democrats, anticipating heavy losses after a seesaw election season, were already pointing fingers.</p> \n  <p>It began weeks ago. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the party’s progressive standard-bearer, blamed Democrats for <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2022/oct/10/democrats-midterms-victory-economy-bernie-sanders\">failing to deliver a strong economic message</a> that addresses the pocketbook concerns of most Americans.</p> \n  <p>“In my view,” he wrote, “it would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of the economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.”</p> \n  <p>Meanwhile, many top Democrats say their party mishandled the issue of crime and public safety.</p> \n  <p>Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, <a href=\"https://prospect.org/politics/how-democrats-mishandled-crime/\">argued</a> in the American Prospect that the party had badly mishandled the issue of crime and public safety, writing that the 2022 midterms would be remembered “as a toxic campaign, but an effective one in labeling Democrats as ‘pro-crime.’”</p> \n  <p>But others say Democrats’ challengers are much deeper. A <a href=\"https://www.thirdway.org/memo/overcoming-the-democratic-party-brand\">policy memo</a> released on the eve of the election, the centrist Democratic think-tank Third Way concluded that the party’s brand had become toxic to swing voters. “Despite a roster of GOP candidates who are extreme by any standard, voters see Democrats as just as extreme, as well as far less concerned about the issues that most worry them,” it stated.</p> \n  <p>Progressives wholeheartedly disagree. A pre-election memo from the Working Families Party national director, Maurice Mitchell, credits progressives for pushing Biden to deliver on key parts of his economic agenda.</p> \n  <p>“Democrats’ passing big and popular legislation and Republican extremism have kept many races much closer than the normal midterm patterns would dictate,” Mitchell wrote. But he warned: “If Democrats face significant losses, those failures of governance and the Democrats who blocked a pro-working-class agenda will bear much of the blame.”</p> \n </div> \n <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T17:36:12.121Z\">at 5.36pm GMT</time></p> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a8cdb8f0850c5a4cd436f\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T17:14:35.524Z\">5.14pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>It’s just after 12pm here in New York, which means that voting is well under way in most places across the country.

Control because candidates for the bench run not on their judicial qualifications but on party tickets with an implicit commitment to make decisions in line with their political values.</p> \n  <p>Republicans have technically controlled the court since 1986, holding four of the seven seats. But one of the judges, the outgoing chief justice, Maureen O’Connor, is widely regarded by the party leadership as having gone rogue by siding with Democrats in some politically sensitive cases including over gerrymandering. And now the highly contentious issues of abortion is likely to be on the agenda following the US supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade.</p> \n  <p>The three conservative candidates, already on the court and seeking reelection, in recent days joined a Republican bus campaign tour alongside the party’s contenders for the US Senate and state governor. No separation of powers there.</p> \n  <p>At a stop in Columbus, one of the judges, Pat Fischer, told a rally that it was important to keep the court out of the hands of “activist judges that are Democrats”. Not activist judges as such, just ones who are Democrats.</p> \n  <p>“It’s critical that the three of us win this race and we go back to having a conservative Ohio supreme court,” he told the rally.</p> \n  <p>The new state supreme court is expected to decide whether to let stand the state’s ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy, brought in after Roe v Wade was overturned. A lower court blocked the measure last month. Although the three Republican contenders for the court all say they will apply the law and not political judgements, each has already made clear their opposition to abortion.</p> \n  <p>Another of the Republican judges, Sharon Kennedy, is running to become chief justice.

The president is slightly unpopular, his party loses some seats and most voters disappear for two years until they turn up in greater numbers for the main show.</p> \n  <p>This year might not buck any of those long-term trends. The Democratic president Joe Biden has watched his popularity <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/05/06/briefing/joe-biden-approval-rating-covid.html\">slump</a> from 53% to 42% over the past year. Polls suggest that Republicans will win the House of Representatives and might even win the Senate too (though if they do, it’s likely to be by a narrower margin). And even though turnout is looking set to be historically <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/oct/23/us-midterm-elections-early-voting\">high</a> by midterm standards, it’s unlikely to beat the numbers in 2020. So, it’s all pretty much electoral business as usual, right?</p> \n  <p>Not quite. Here are some of the factors that could shape the votes that come in over the next few days – and, as a result, shape the country over the next few years.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Redistricting</strong></h2> \n  <p>Under Trump, gerrymandering and other anti-democratic measures scaled up. There have been concerns about the way that kind of partisan redistricting might play out in this year’s elections – where the electoral district is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/mar/24/gerrymandering-wisconsin-purple-state-rightwing-measures\">purple</a>, this is likely to work in Republicans’ favor including parts of Texas and Florida.</p> \n  <p>But, as the New York Times <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/30/upshot/midterms-gerrymandering-republicans.html\">pointed out</a> in September, this might not wind up being such a huge advantage for Republicans. While it’s true that the map does work in their favor, the edge isn’t insurmountable for Democrats (and it certainly isn’t irreversible either).</p> \n  <h2><strong>Restrictions</strong></h2> \n  <p>In the space of just six months, 22 new laws were passed in 2021 that restricted people’s access to vote in 14 states. <a href=\"https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/voting-laws-roundup-may-2021\">Research</a> from the Brennan centre has indicated that voter suppression is at its worst level in over a decade. Whether those laws make it hard to count mail-in ballots or make it difficult to vote in person, their overall effect tends to disenfranchise those who are already disempowered by other systems in the country – whether it’s people with disabilities or people of color who are more likely to be affected by voter ID laws. It’s also worth pointing out that laws like these are uncommon in most other countries that call themselves democracies.</p> \n  <p>Republicans have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2021/dec/27/democracy-under-attack-trump-republicans\">led</a> these efforts in the hopes that voter access laws will work in their favor.</p> \n  <h2><strong>Abortion and the economy</strong></h2> \n  <p>Sure, there are the same ideological arguments about immigration and the economy that show up in any election but this year feels different. There is a general atmosphere of distrust fueled by attacks on election officials and lies about “stolen” ballots that has led some to feel that they are voting about democracy itself. And, since the supreme court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision was overturned in June, this year’s vote has for many felt like a vote about abortion access. Even the economy has taken on a greater urgency than in recent midterms with rising consumer prices squeezing many US household budgets.</p> \n  <p>Lastly, polling is <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2020/nov/04/the-pollsters-were-wrong-again-heres-what-we-know-so-far\">still</a> deeply problematic so all predictions about the House and the Senate should be treated with caution until the votes are counted. A Wall Street Journal survey that found white suburban women are switching parties was based on just 297 respondents (which, shockingly, is actually a pretty good response rate for such a specific slice of the country). That kind of research is not only imprecise but it has the potential to be undemocratic when headlines tell voters what the future looks like before they have even had their say.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more of Mona Chalabi’s analysis here:</strong> </p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/us-midterms-2022-voter-trends-factors\">US midterms 2022: what are the factors shaping voters’ choices?</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a50ac8f0850c5a4cd404a\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T12:54:15.203Z\">12.54pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Officials in <strong>Philadelphia</strong> have said that counting votes will take longer than expected after a last minute u-turn to reinstate what is known as poll book reconciliation.

In New York’s third congressional district, either Democrat <strong>Robert Zimmerman</strong> or Republican <strong>George Devolder-Santos</strong> will become the first openly gay person to represent Long Island in the House.</p> \n  <p>As Republicans look to take back the House, their playbook has relied upon nominating a diverse slate of candidates in battleground districts that will probably determine control of the lower chamber. The strategy builds upon the party’s momentum from 2020, when Republicans flipped 14 House districts where they nominated a woman or a person of color.</p> \n  <p>Overall, Republicans have nominated 67 candidates of color in House races, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee.

Never that is, until now. Today’s anti-democratic movement is propelled not by genuine controversy or scandal, but rather by their commitment to ending competitive elections in the United States. There is no other way to interpret their belief that only one side, the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a>, can legitimately be considered to win, and the plans that they hold to make this belief a reality.</p> \n  <p>The problems can be expected to start this November, when Republican candidates who lose will question the validity of the results and try to stir unrest. State officials who do win will begin to act on <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/2/23331716/election-denier-2024-mastriano-lake-finchem\">their plans</a> to sabotage future polls by centralizing power in their own offices, de-registering millions of voters, and moving to error-prone hand-counting systems. Then, if voter suppression doesn’t prevent a Democratic win in 2024, they’ll just suppress the evidence instead and announce that they are sending Republican electors to the electoral college. Meanwhile, the majority of Republican House candidates in 2022 are election-deniers, and a Republican-controlled Congress might attempt to sabotage the certification of the presidential vote on 6 January 2025.</p> \n  <p>Each of these potential points of failure threatens the integrity of the 2024 presidential election. The breadth and depth of the anti-democratic movement also means that they are likely to pose other problems which are difficult to anticipate. Whatever means they find of sabotaging the vote, it would be foolish to rely on the conservative-dominated supreme court to stop them, particularly if the country has been plunged into civil unrest and violence.</p> \n  <p><strong>Read more here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/08/future-of-american-democracy-stake-midterm-election\">Andrew Gawthorpe – The future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2022/nov/08/future-of-american-democracy-stake-midterm-election\">The future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections | Andrew Gawthorpe</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a388b8f08f43127befb5e\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T11:42:52.056Z\">11.42am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you would like something to listen to about the US midterm elections, then Today in Focus is for you.

We’ve got to pick a path, and the path that we’re on is not right,” Nate DeFazio, a small business owner worried about inflation, said outside of a Mehmet Oz rally.</p> \n   <p>“If we do not maintain a majority in the Senate, Roe falling will be just the beginning,” Ronna Dewey, 54, said at a John Fetterman rally.</p> \n   <p>“It’s really important to me to be able to graduate high school and enter adulthood in a state of having all my rights intact and not feeling like, ‘Oh, I wish I’d graduated 10 years ago,’” said Jordan Bailkin, a Democratic high school senior who is voting for the first time.</p> \n   <p>“Personal freedom and the freedom to dissent – I feel that both of those things are under attack,” Jason Dekker, a conservative from York County said.</p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a3c018f08f43127befb95\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T11:25:17.632Z\">11.25am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>Overnight Stephen Collinson at CNN offered this analysis of how – and why – he expects things to pan out in favor of the Republicans in the next few days. <a href=\"https://edition.cnn.com/2022/11/07/politics/democrats-nightmare-scenario-election-eve-analysis/index.html\">He writes</a>:</p> \n  <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> \n   <p>It’s too early for postmortems. Forty million Americans have already voted. And the uncertainty baked into modern polling means no one can be sure a red wave is coming. Democrats could still cling onto the Senate even if the House falls.</p> \n   <p>But the way each side is talking on election eve, and the swathe of blue territory – from New York to Washington state – that Democrats are defending offer a clear picture of Republican momentum.</p> \n   <p>A nation split down the middle politically, which is united only by a sense of dissatisfaction with its trajectory, is getting into a habit of repeatedly using elections to punish the party with the most power.</p> \n   <p>That means Democrats are most exposed this time.</p> \n   <p>If the president’s party takes a drubbing, there will be much Democratic finger-pointing over Biden’s messaging strategy on inflation – a pernicious force that has punched holes in millions of family budgets.</p> \n   <p>Just as in last year’s losing off-year gubernatorial race in Virginia, Democrats are closing the campaign warning about democracy and Trump’s influence while Republicans believe they are addressing the issue voters care about most.<br></p> \n  </blockquote> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a39118f08f51359d2fd04\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"profile/sam-levine\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T11:15:31.184Z\">11.15am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <h2 class=\"block-title\">When will we know who won US midterm races — and what to expect on election day</h2> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p><strong>We probably won’t know the winners on election night</strong></p> \n  <p>In many races, we’re not going to know who won on election night. After the polls close, candidate vote totals are likely to shift as local officials continue to count ballots.</p> \n  <p>Once the polls close, <a href=\"https://electionlab.mit.edu/research/election-return-reporting\">election workers tabulate</a> the votes in each precinct and transmit them to the county’s central election office. Each county reports their results to the state.</p> \n  <p>Vote totals are likely to shift throughout the evening as well as in the days that follow election day as votes continue to be counted. That shift isn’t unusual and can be explained by two dynamics, said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who specializes in election administration.</p> \n  <p>First, he said, the places that report their votes first tend to be smaller, Republican jurisdictions. Second, many places report their in-person election day vote first and their mail-in absentee vote later. Those votes tend to skew towards <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/democrats\">Democrats</a>.</p> \n  <p>Because these totals can change, there should be deep skepticism of attempts to claim victory before votes are counted.</p> \n  <p><strong>Projections about which candidates will win are separate from official results</strong></p> \n  <p>As officials report election results, news organizations, including the <a href=\"https://www.ap.org/about/our-role-in-elections/how-we-call-races\">Associated Press</a> and major television networks, scrutinize data to try to make projections about which candidate will win. This process is independent of the official election efforts to count votes.</p> \n  <p>In some races, experts are able to quickly make a projection about who is going to win a race. If a candidate from one party has consistently won a race, for example, and the voting patterns on election night appear to immediately be in line with previous elections, news organizations may feel confident in making a projection with only a fraction of the vote counted.</p> \n  <p>But in competitive races where there’s a slim margin between the candidates, and a lot of the vote hasn’t been reported yet, experts are much more cautious and will not make a prediction.</p> \n  <p>As the vote count continues, forecasters compare the margin separating the candidate with where in the state there are still votes outstanding. Once they feel confident that there’s no path to victory for one candidate, they will declare a winner.</p> \n  <p><strong>Some will claim that they see election errors (and most will turn out to be false)</strong></p> \n  <p>Every election day, there are voters who claim to see something amiss at the polls or during the vote counting process. In 2020, many of those claims were loudly amplified by Donald Trump and continue to live on today, even though they’ve been debunked over and over again.</p> \n  <p>In 2022, we’re likely to hear similar claims. Each one of those should be taken with a “giant grain of salt”, David Becker, the founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said. “I would look at any claim from anyone saying that, regardless of party of election, highly skeptically.</p> \n  <p>“These things are largely driven by losing candidates or candidates that expect to lose,” he added. The claims, he said, are “almost always proven to be false. Or easily explainable.”</p> \n  <p>In 2020, for example, there were claims from observers about ballots being wheeled into a central counting facility in Detroit late during election night. Those ballots had <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-9961890106\">already been verified</a> by the local election office and there was nothing wrong with their late arrival time. The claim was nonetheless touted by those who sought to sow doubt about the election results.</p> \n  <p><strong>You can read more from Sam Levine’s explainer here: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/midterm-election-day-race-won-when-timing-deadlines\">When will we know who won US midterm races — and what to expect on election day</a></strong></p> \n  <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n   <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/08/midterm-election-day-race-won-when-timing-deadlines\">When will we know who won US midterm races — and what to expect on election day</a> </p> \n  </aside> \n </div> \n</div> \n<div id=\"block-636a37a58f08f51359d2fcfa\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> \n <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T11:05:44.841Z\">11.05am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p> \n <div class=\"block-elements\"> \n  <p>If you missed it last night, here is the clip of former US president <strong>Donald Trump</strong>, speaking at a rally in Ohio, saying he will be making a “big announcement” on 15 November, hinting that he will mount a 2024 presidential run.</p> \n  <p>“I’m going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday, 15 November at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida,” Trump told supporters at the rally for Republican Senate candidate JD Vance.

Thank you for reading on several midterm election races happening across the country. Here’s a summary of everything that happened: For Democrats, Tuesday’s midterm election races could mean losing control of Congress. Several closely watched Senate races could determine the outcome of which party will control Congress for the rest of Joe Biden’s first term in office. John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden’s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today’s midterm elections, which are expected to go badly for Democrats. Kerry delivered that promise while speaking at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt. The Guardian caught up with a number of voters across several key states, including Michigan, Georgia, and Pennsylvania. Many spoke about a number of issues that were motivating them to cast a ballot today, including the state of democracy and abortion access in the US. The first set of exit polling from CNN spells dismal results for Democrats, as a majority of the US electorate is angry and dissatisfied with the state of the country. GOP lawsuits challenging voter rules have caused hold ups in some districts, including Philadelphia, as election judges are now required to go through an extra checking process to monitor for double voting, a process that could take three days. Another lawsuit caused mail-in ballots in Philadelphia that have inaccurate or missing dates to be rejected, causing thousands to show up and recast their ballots. The Florida state department sent a letter to the US Department of Justice saying that federal election monitors won’t be permitted inside the state’s polling places. The letter comes as several key races are happening in Florida, including the election for Florida governor. Donald Trump cast a ballot at a polling place in Palm Beach, Florida. Trump gave some brief comments to media waiting outside the polling place, and confirmed that he voted for incumbent governor Ron DeSantis. You can follow this blog, which will update as polling places across the country begin to close. If you’re in line to vote, stay there! Have a great night and happy election day, everyone! John Kerry, the US climate envoy, has vowed that Joe Biden’s administration will press ahead on climate action regardless of the outcome of today’s midterm elections, which are expected to go badly for Democrats. Kerry, speaking at the Cop27 climate talks in Egypt, said that he hoped there would be a Congress would act on the climate crisis but “even if we don’t, folks, president Biden is more determined than ever to continue what we are doing.” “Most of what we are doing cannot be changed by anyone else coming along,” Kerry added, noting that cities and states across America banded together to commit to the Paris climate agreement when Donald Trump removed the US from the pact when president. US officials in Egypt hope that the inflation reduction act bill passed in August, which contains more than $370bn in climate spending and called “one of the single most important pieces of legislation over the past 50 years or so” by Kerry in his speech, will drive deep cuts in emissions regardless of the midterms. But Kerry conceded it was possible that Republicans could “launch an assault” on Biden’s climate agenda if they win at least one house of Congress in the elections. The GOP has decried what it calls Biden’s “radical green agenda” and could stall or hamper the rollout of measures aimed at boosting renewable energy deployment. Biden arrives at Cop27 on Friday, potentially in a downcast mood following the outcome of the elections. The Guardian’s Abené Clayton, reporting on the California gubernatorial race from Los Angeles It may have been one of the least anxiety-inducing midterm races in the nation. California governor Gavin Newsom is expected to cruise to re-election and easily beat Republican state senator Brian Dahle to serve his second term at the helm of the US’ most populous state. Last year, Newsom survived a recall attempt driven by critics of his handling of the pandemic. This year, with re-election in deep blue California all but secure, he took his message to the national stage, spending millions of dollars on ads addressing issues like gun control and abortion rights in states including Mississippi and Texas. Newsom’s national effort has sparked speculation among political analysts and officials he’s considering a run for president -- a rumor Newsom has consistently denied. But as my colleague Maanvi Singh wrote a few weeks ago: “Denial is the tradition of pretty much every politician who has flirted with chief executive ambitions.” More reporting on voting in Michigan, from the Guardian’s Sam Levine Taylor Morgan, 26, cast her vote Tuesday just a few blocks from the main campus of the University of Michigan, in Ann Arbor. A driving force getting her to the polls is Proposal 3, an effort to enshrine abortion protections in the Michigan constitution. “Reproductive rights and reproductive freedom are super important to me as a Black woman in Michigan,” she said just before she cast her ballot. “I just want to make sure that those rights are maintained. I feel like if that’s not something that you believe in or support, you have that right. But you don’t have the right to tell the people what they can do with their bodies.” Morgan said she’s concerned about efforts to overturn the election, but hopes that the margin will be so wide, any efforts will quickly fall apart. “My hope is that a lot of people turn out so everything is indisputable,” said Morgan, a medical student. Abby Anderson, a senior at the University of Michigan studying performance art management, said she also was motivated by the abortion proposal. “I’m very pro-choice. It’s a cause that I care a lot about. Particular since I’m not from Michigan, and I could have chosen to vote in the state that I’m from, but I felt that my vote had more of an impact here because it’s more of a swing,” she said. There’s some concern about potentially low turnout from young voters, but both Morgan and Anderson said they thought young people would vote in high numbers. Some of her professor had even said it’s OK if students couldn’t make it to class on Tuesday because they needed to vote, Anderson said. “I’m young and a lot of my friends, they’re very adamant about coming out to vote,” she said. “It seems like a lot of people are lining up to go to the on campus polling places. I feel like young people are starting to realize what they stand for and what they don’t stand for. So you’re gonna see a lot of young people coming out in droves to make their voices heard. At least that’s what it looks like to me,” Morgan said. CNN has published its first set of exit polls. The poll readings spell fairly dismal news for Democrats ahead of midterm election results, with polls showing that the majority of the American electorate are angry with the state of the country under Biden’s presidency. While all eyes are on New York’s gubernatorial race, the outcome of New York’s 21st Congressional District contest might speak to the staying power of MAGA-style politics—or whether voters have grown weary of Trump’s inflammatory politics. Republican incumbent Elise Stefanik is running against Democrat Matt Castelli, a former CIA officer who served on the national security council. Stefanik became the No. 3 House Republican after Liz Cheney was kicked out of the role of conference chair amid the Wyoming congresswoman’s ongoing criticism of Trump. While Stefanik was a moderate when she entered the House in 2015, the congress member has increasingly moved right. Some consider Stefanik to be a potential 2024 vice-presidential candidate. Not everyone in Stefanik’s district is enthused by her political ascent—including her statements relating to baseless claims that there were sweeping “irregularities” in the previous national election, per CNN. Jennifer Mann, a Castelli campaign volunteer and chair of the Brunswick, New York Democratic Committee, decried Stefanik’s statements about the 2020 election. “She does not support democracy. She voted against supporting the results of the election even though she knew— she had information—there was no fraud. I find that terrifying.” Mann, who cast her ballot early, said that many in the district are worried about affordable healthcare and prescription drugs; Stefanik, she said, “voted against their interests every single time.” Like many other voters, Mann voiced frustration over polarization, saying: “I’m tired of the parisian politics.” As for the governor’s race, Mann said: “Hochul is not my ideal candidate, I’m not going to lie. She is at least somebody who will support the democratic process.” “She will make sure that women’s rights are guaranteed for us—not having the government take it from us,” Mann said. Stefanik was among the some 80 Republicans supporting national legislation that would prohibit most abortions after 15 weeks. “That’s another thing I really dislike about Stefanik: She wants to take away states’ rights by sponsoring this nationwide abortion ban.” In New York, the Democratic governor, Kathy Hochul, and Republican challenger Lee Zeldin are making their last-minute pitches to voters in the gubernatorial race. While the Cook Political Report predicts that the governor’s race will “likely” be for Democrats, her lead over Zeldin has slimmed dramatically—from a double-digit margin to just four points over the course of several weeks, according to CNBC. “This city is back and I want to lead this state into the next four years and possibly beyond with a sense of optimism we have not had here in a long time,” Hochul said during a campaign stop on Manhattan’s Upper East Side Tuesday, according to the New York Post. “That will start first thing tomorrow morning.” Zeldin, who like most Republicans across the US has made crime a key tenet of his platform, tried to hammer Hochul on public safety during a campaign stop at the Nassau County, Long Island Republican headquarters. “If you go and ask a lot of Democrats who are inside of New York City who are fed up, they don’t want to be told that the crime in the subway is just a perception. They should just look away, there’s nothing to see here,” the Post quoted Zeldin as saying. Democrats outside of New York have taken notice of Zeldin’s rise in the polls and appear to be considering him a serious threat. President Joe Biden appeared alongside Hochul on Sunday to encourage voters to cast their ballots in what has become an unexpectedly tight race. “New York, you have two days to make sure the rest of New York knows the good that they have in Kathy Hochul,” Biden said, according to Politico. “Two days until the most important election in our lifetime.” Philadelphia voters have encountered some issues while trying to cast their votes, both mail in ballots and in-person votes on Tuesday. Thousands of mail-in ballots were recast in the Brotherly Love city following a ruling on a GOP lawsuit that invalidated mail-in ballots that had missing or inaccurate dates. The decision, made last Tuesday, launched a mass volunteer effort in the city on Monday night to alert those impacted about their ballots. On Tuesday, election officials were also mandated to check for double voting, thanks to a separate GOP lawsuit. The checking process could take several days and slow down the vote count process. From the Washington Post: The process, known as “poll book reconciliation,” is a way to prevent double voting that Philadelphia implemented in 2020 amid a dramatic expansion of mail ballots in the state. It requires that election workers interrupt ballot counting to scan poll books so that the lists of voters who returned mail ballots can be compared to those who voted in-person. The process generally takes three days, court records show. Here’s some helpful context for Tuesday’s midterm elections and what it could mean for Democrats’ control of Congress, from the Guardian’s Chris McGreal and Joan E Greve The Biden administration was braced for a bad night on Tuesday as the US midterm election results threatened to rob the Democrats of control of Congress, just as former president Donald Trump appears ready to announce another run for the White House. But the Democrats were holding out hope that they might just retain control of the US Senate if a handful of closely fought races fell their way. The final results, which will determine control of Congress for the remainder of Biden’s first term as president and further constrain his legislative agenda, could take days or even weeks in some closely fought Senate races. Delayed results are likely to fuel legal challenges and conspiracy theories about vote-rigging, particularly if the remaining seats determine control of the Senate. The ground was already being laid in Pennsylvania, where a close US Senate race is being fought between Mehmet Oz, a Trump-backed Republican, and Democrat John Fetterman, who has been battling to assure voters he is fit for office after a stroke. Earlier on election day on Tuesday, the agency overseeing the voting in Philadelphia said it will delay counting thousands of paper ballots because of a Republican lawsuit that said the process was open to duplicate voting. Dozens of Republican candidates for the Senate, the House of Representatives and other major offices have refused to confirm that they will accept the result if they lose amid a swirl of false claims of fraud, stemming from Trump’s assertion that the 2020 presidential election was stolen from him and kept alive by the Republican party leadership.

More reporting on Californians voting on Proposition 30, from the Guardian’s Maanvi Singh Californians are voting today on a ballot measure that would tax the state’s richest residents in an effort to get more electric vehicles on the road. The measure, Proposition 30, would hike taxes by 1.75% on those earning $2m or more annually to raise between $3bn and $5bn annually to subsidize households, businesses and schools; buy zero-emission cars, trucks and buses; fund infrastructure to charge electric vehicles; and bolster wildfire prevention efforts. Proponents of the measure, including the coalition of environmental and labor groups that developed it, say the tax would provide urgently needed funds to hasten the transition to zero-emission vehicles, and reduce the disproportionate burden of pollution on low-income, minority communities across the state. Detractors, including the California governor, Gavin Newsom, claim the proposal is a corporate carve-out for Lyft, the ride-hailing company that has backed the measure and helped fund its campaign. Read more about Proposition 30 and the fraught battle over it here: The latest on Los Angeles’ mayoral race, from the Guardian’s Lois Beckett By the time Los Angeles residents headed to polls on Tuesday, mayoral hopeful and billionaire real estate developer Rick Caruso had poured more than $100m of his own fortune into his campaign to become the city’s next leader. Caruso, who’s battling Congresswoman Karen Bass in a closely contested race, has backed his own campaign with $101m as of late last week, campaign ethics filing show, outspending his opponent by more than 10 to one. The developer, who is running a pro-police, tough-on-crime campaign, came in second to Bass, a former community organizer and leader of the Congressional Black Caucus, in the city’s June primary. But Bass’ strong lead over Caruso in recent weeks evaporated, according to a recent poll of likely voters, with her 45% to 41% lead over Caruso within the poll’s margin of error. Caruso, who has an estimated net worth of $5.3bn, is nearing a mayoral campaign record set by billionaire Mike Bloomberg, who spent $109m of his own money to win his third term as mayor of New York City in 2009. Total political spending of more than $120m on a mayoral race is a striking sum, especially for a contest in which the key issue is LA’s homelessness. There are at least 41,000 unhoused people in Los Angeles county, many of them unsheltered, and living, in tents, cars, RVs and makeshift structures. Bass has repeatedly attacked Caruso’s campaign spending, saying that if she had $90m or $100m to spend, she would spend it on affordable housing. Concerns over the spread of misinformation and disinformation on social media platforms are a recurring theme of each election but with the recent mass layoffs at Twitter following Elon Musk’s acquisition of the platform civil liberties groups are particularly on high alert. The company laid off a reported 50% of the workforce or an estimated 3,700 workers last week just days before the midterms. Twitter’s head of safety and integrity, Yoel Roth said that layoffs affected 15% of the company’s trust and safety team which is charged with moderating content including combating misinformation. That has the leaders of civil liberties groups such as Color of Change, Free Press and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, who met with Musk to discuss how Twitter will deal with hate speech, convinced that the company will not be sufficiently staffed to handle attempts to mislead voters today. “Retaining and enforcing election-integrity measures requires an investment in the human expert staff, factcheckers, and moderators, who are being shown the door today,” said Jessica J González, co-CEO of Free Press. While it’s still early in the day, months-old viral videos and tweets falsely claiming Republicans were being barred from the polls have already been recirculated today, according to the Washington Post. Pennsylvania is at the heart of the battle for control of Congress and key governorships across the country. To get a sense of Democrats’ political fortunes in this consequential battleground, I spoke to Ed Rendell, a former Democratic governor of Pennsylvania. Rendell is bullish on the governor’s race, where Democrat Josh Shapiro has maintained a consistent lead over his Republican opponent, the election-denying conservative Doug Mastriano. But he has jitters about the Senate race between John Fetterman, the Democrat, and Mehmet Oz, the Republican, which is rated a toss up. Key to the race, he says, is Black voter turnout in cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh. If Democrats fail to mobilize this crucial constituency, it will be hard, if not impossible, for them to eke out a win in a close contest. Rendell is hopeful Obama’s visit to the state on Saturday will have a “dramatic impact” on turnout, especially among Black voters, by reminding voters of the stakes and making the affirmative case for electing Democrats. And he does not believe, as some in his party do, that Biden’s campaign appearance in Philadelphia on Saturday, alongside Obama, Fetterman and Shapiro, will hurt the Democratic ticket, In fact, he said it’s possible that the enduring affection for Biden in places like Scranton, where the president was born, may help boost support for Democrats in that industrial corner of the state. “If you don’t like Joe Biden and you want to send him a message ... you vote against him, but not because he appears with Fetterman,” Rendell said. “That doesn’t change anybody’s mind.” The Guardian’s Abené Clayton, reporting on voting conditions from Los Angeles A winter storm has brought days of rain, snow and flood warnings to southern and northern California, and while it may have ended California’s fire season it also has led midterm election hopefuls to implore voters to defy the conditions to cast their ballots. There are more questions than clear answers around the impact that weather has on voter turnout and ultimately the results of an election, but candidates aren’t leaving anything up to chance or people’s instincts to stay dry, warm and off of wet roads. “Since we don’t like rain, I have to make sure that people vote. We can’t lose this election because of the rain. That would be crazy,” Karen Bass, the progressive candidate for mayor of Los Angeles, said during a pre-election day Instagram live interview with the actor Rosario Dawson. On the other side of the state, Brooke Jenkins, San Francisco’s interim district attorney who is running to retain her seat, is calling on people to come out to the polls, “rain or shine”. Matt Gunderson, a Southern California state senate candidate whose campaign promises include repealing laws that downgrades crimes from felonies to misdemeanors. Donald Trump, who lost Arizona in 2020, has weighed in on the tabulation machine issues in Maricopa county. Trump posted on Truth Social, saying the machine problems were mostly affecting conservative or Republican areas. It’s not clear exactly which sites have been experiencing the tabulation problems, but voters around the county have reported them. “Can this possibly be true when a vast majority of Republicans waited for today to Vote? Here we go again? The people will not stand for it!!!” Trump wrote. Earlier on Tuesday, election officials in Maricopa County reported that about 20% of polling places in the county were experiencing problems. The Guardian’s Erum Salam reports on the voting situation in Texas Things are heating up in Texas, one of the most difficult states to cast a vote. Reports have emerged of voters being turned away from eight polling sites in Bell county, an area north-east of Austin, after check-in machines malfunctioned because of an issue relating to the time change. Bell county election officials requested an additional hour for voting from the Texas secretary of state due to the issues. At a time when doubt is being unnecessarily cast on the integrity of the American electoral process, Bell county does not inspire confidence in those already skeptical, but county officials told the Guardian that the issue with the machines only affected voters’ ability to check in, not their ability to vote. Bell county’s public information officer, James Stafford, said: “For some reason, computers at those eight locations did not automatically update to the new time. As a result, the central computer, recognizing a discrepancy, would not allow those devices to come online, and we were unable to open those sites to voters. The critical issue that we want to communicate is that we have not had any issues related to ballots or tabulation machines. The issue was limited to those check-in devices. I also would say that, seeing the work and the passion of both our elections and technology services staff as they worked diligently to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible.” Confidence in the electoral process is integral to the preservation of democracy and boosting that confidence has been the primary objective of some. The US Department of Justice announced yesterday it will send federal monitors to polling sites across the country, including three counties in Texas, to ensure smooth sailing on election day. During early voting, the Beaumont chapter of the NAACP alleged Black voters were being harassed and intimidated by election workers in Jefferson county. Jessica Daye, a local voter, alleged she witnessed other Black voters being shadowed by election workers who demanded they say their addresses out loud, despite already being checked in to vote. On Monday, Daye, the NAACP and The Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights Under Law filed a lawsuit and a federal judge issued an order prohibiting the discriminatory behavior. On the morning of election day, the Election Protection coalition – the nation’s oldest and largest non-partisan voter protection coalition – held a virtual press conference “outlining resources and guidance available to voters in need of information or facing intimidation at the polls”. On the call were leaders from the Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the Texas Civil Rights Project, and top of the agenda was addressing any voting incidents at polling sites or ballot drop boxes in key states across the country. Lawyers’ Committee For Civil Rights Under Law called the incident in Beaumont “a gross instance of invasion of privacy and voter intimidation”. In the call, the Texas Civil Rights Project said it received more reports of machine malfunctions, voter intimidation, polling sites opening late, poll workers dressed in partisan attire in a few places, and issues with mail ballots that were either not received or rejected. Voting in Texas ends at 7pm central. As millions across the country voted on Tuesday, Joe Biden tweeted an encouragement for people to participate in elections. Behind the scenes, Biden also spoke with a number of key leaders in the Democratic party. From the White house press office: This afternoon, the President spoke individually by phone with Democratic Governors Association Chair Roy Cooper, DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney, DSCC Chair Gary Peters, and DNC Senior Advisor Cedric Richmond. He also spoke jointly to DNC Chair Jaime Harrison and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Carlisa Johnson reports on Joy to the Polls, an arts-based voting initiative in Georgia In Georgia, young voters make up 17% of the state’s voting population. However, young voter turnout remained lower than in previous elections at the end of early voting. Now, the final get out the vote efforts are happening to capture young voters. Throughout the state, voting rights organizers are taking to the streets to help voters get to the polls, cast their votes and have their voices heard. Today, Joy to the Polls, an arts-based initiative, is making eight stops throughout the metro area to encourage voters to head to the polls and celebrate the joy of voting. At its third stop of the day, Joy to the Polls featured a performance by recording artist Tate “Baby Tate” Farris in East Atlanta. Farris, a Georgia native, said she came out to remind young people to vote. “Young people have power. This is the opportunity to take that power that [they] have and use it by being active in the election process.” This initiative, which originated in 2020, creates party-like atmospheres at polling places throughout the state, hoping to ease the stress of the voting process. Kaelyn Kastle, co-host of the East Atlanta stop, believes events like Joy to the Polls are critical in places like Georgia, where elections are won by thin margins. “We all know that the system is broken, and things need to be changed,” said Kastle. “Young people have to understand that their vote does matter because we’ve seen how close elections in Georgia can be.” The Guardian’s Andrew Lawrence reports from Decatur, Georgia Long voter queues were hard to come by, a sign that can be taken one of two ways: either most residents are already part of the giant early turnout, or simply got turned around. “Because the polling places are different from the early voting locations, that’s caused some confusion,” says Karen “Mix” Mixon, vice-chair of the DeKalb County Democratic Committee. On a cloudless 75F day, Mixon stood outside an early voting location in the South Dekalb Mall to redirect voters toward their assigned polling place. With SB 202, the aggressive voter suppression law President Biden dubbed “Jim Crow 2.0”, finally baring its teeth on election day, Mixon notes mobilizer groups have to be extra careful about extending help this election cycle. “The law is you have to be 150ft from the building where people are voting, or 25 feet from voters who are standing in line to wait to vote,” Mixon says. “We ordered tape measures that are 150ft long and spray chalk, and we mark that off so that we are following the law.” With mobilizing groups forbidden from approaching voters to make sure they’re at the right place (much less offer them water), volunteers can basically only wave and smile and yell and hope lost voters approach them. Mixon made herself easy enough to find outside the mall with a sign urging passers by to remind friends to vote. The Guardian’s Andrew Lawrence reports from Atlanta Mike South cast his ballot at Grace International Church with the economy top of mind. “My retirement has shrunk by 50%,” he said. To say he worked hard for it barely tells the story. After launching a decade long career at Nasa as computers expert following the Challenger explosion, South, 64, pivoted to directing and acting in adult movies before cementing his legend as an industry gossip columnist. In 2013, CNBC pronounced him one of porn’s 10 most powerful people. Porn drove his political engagement. “There was a time when free speech would’ve been an issue, especially in Atlanta,” he says. “Most of the people in my business are hardcore Democrats, but I kinda stand out because I’m more libertarian – which I would expect them to be.” South says he voted for libertarian candidates whenever possible, including in the senate race between Herschel Walker and Raphael Warnock. (“The truth is I don’t like either one of them,” he quipped, as his support dog Lola heeled.) Third-party voters could have a significant impact on that race, which is trending closer toward another senate runoff. A new Warnock ad tips voters to the possibility of having to return to the polls again over the holiday season. After being barraged with campaign ads for the past seven years, in the country, South winces at the thought of yet another trip to the polls. “I’m over it.” Election officials in Georgia’s largest county removed two workers from a polling site on the morning of Tuesday’s midterm races after their colleagues shared social media posts of the pair at the US Capitol attack on 6 January 2021. Fulton county elections officials told media outlets that they fired the workers – a mother and her son – about 15 minutes before the polls opened Tuesday morning. They had been assigned to a polling site at a library in the community of Johns Creek. The mother and son fell under scrutiny after the woman made a comment that caught the attention of a colleague while they were at an event for poll workers, Fulton county’s interim elections director, Nadine Williams, told the local news station WSB-TV. Colleagues of the woman also found social media posts by her which were reported to the county, WSB-TV added. Williams would not elaborate on the nature of the posts. But the Washington Post reported that it was provided with copies of the social media screeds in question, and they showed the woman’s family forming part of the mob of Donald Trump supporters who staged the Capitol attack. According to the newspaper, one of the posts read: “I stood up for what’s right today in Washington DC. This election was a sham. [Trump vice-president] Mike Pence is a traitor. I was tear gassed FOUR times. I have pepper spray in my throat. I stormed the Capitol building. And my children have had the best learning experience of their lives.” Trump supporters attacked the Capitol in a failed attempt to prevent the congressional certification of the former Republican president’s defeat to his Democratic rival Joe Biden in the 2020 election. One of the mob’s stated aims was to hang Pence after it falsely accused him of failing to avail himself of the ability to single-handedly prevent Biden’s certification. Officials have linked nine deaths to the insurrection, including suicides by law enforcement officers traumatized after successfully defending the building from the pro-Trump mob. Hundreds of participants have been charged criminally in connection with the attack, and many have either pleaded guilty or otherwise have been convicted over their roles. During the 2020 presidential race, Fulton county experienced long lines at the polls, administrative mistakes and death threats against election workers. The Washington Post reported that the turmoil during the election two years earlier prompted Fulton county to prepare for Tuesday’s midterms – which many regard as a referendum on American democracy – by assigning police to more than half of its 300 or so polling places, with other officers patrolling between sites. Georgia is holding some of Tuesday’s most-closely watched elections, including the race between incumbent Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican challenger Herschel Walker that could determine which political party controls the US Senate. A rematch from the 2018 electoral showdown between incumbent Republican governor Brian Kemp and Democratic challenger Stacey Abrams is also being watched nationwide on Tuesday. When Jeff Zapor showed up at his polling place in South Lyon, in the Detroit suburbs, on Tuesday, the most pressing race on his mind was the contest for secretary of state, the elected official who oversees voting and elections in Michigan. That in itself is extraordinary. Long overlooked downballot races, there has been an enormous amount of attention on secretary of state races since the 2020 election, when their role in overseeing vote counting came into focus as Donald Trump tried to overturn the election. Michigan is one of several states where the Republican nominee for secretary of state questioned and tried to overturned the results of the 2020 race. Standing outside his polling place, an elementary school, Michigan, Zapor said he voted for Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat, who is running for a second term. She leads her opponent Kristina Karamo, a community college professor, in the polls. “I think election deniers on the ballot is a very dangerous thing,” Zapor, a 46-year-old mental health counselor said. “When you’re running on a platform of complete abject falsehoods, to me, that shows a complete lack of character. And you’re running for the exact wrong reason.” Zapor added that he was concerned that there could be a repeat of efforts to overturn the election, like there were in 2020. “I think it’s a certainty. I’m very concerned. Both in Michigan and in the nation, in 2024, I guess even in this election, will continue to be divisive and to see violence would not surprise me. I really hope I’m wrong, but that’s what I think,” he said. South Lyon is a competitive area in Oakland county, a battleground in Michigan. Another voter, who would only give his middle name, Alex, said he was also deeply concerned about election denialism. “I’m concerned in general that the truth in general has eluded us and many will continue to leverage what happened in 2020 and for false information in general,” he said. Another voter, who would only give his first name, Tom, said he voted for Michigan governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat, because she was the “lesser of two evils.” He said he also voted for Benson, who sees the state’s motor vehicle offices in addition to elections, because he recently had a quick appointment renewing his driver’s license. “She did what she said he was going to do,” he said. In Michigan, students are coming out for Slotkin in Lansing, whether they like her or not. “I don’t like much about Slotkin, but everyone else was worse,” said Kathryne Ford, 26, a biochemistry PHD candidate at Michigan State University outside of the Don Johnson Fieldhouse this morning. Ford called Slotkin a “cop”, with reference to her career as a CIA analyst, but lists abortion restrictions as her top concern this election cycle. “Abortion is a human right. The government should not be able to control what happens to your own body,” she said. Camille Mikolas, 25, wore braids and a big smile as she went to cast her vote for Slotkin. “I don’t want to have a baby!” she laughed. Talking about her support for the referendum looking to enshrine abortion rights in Michigan’s state constitution, she added “Conservatives are pretty good at saying my body my choice when it comes to vaccines or whatever, but not when it comes to this. And I don’t think that’s fair.” Mikolas said she’ll be voting Democrat down the ticket today. But the issue runs both ways for other voters. “I like Elissa,” said Belinda Fitzpatrick, 59, a swing voter. “But I voted against her. My biggest issue is the abortion thing. People are just using it like contraception,” said Fitzpatrick, who said she will also be voting against the proposal to enshrine abortion rights. Fitzpatrick will vote Republican down the ticket, as Michiganders also choose their governor and attorney general today. “I think it’s time for Republicans to have the power back,” she said. Trump briefly stopped to speak with reporters outside the polling place, confirming that he did vote for incumbent Florida governor Ron DeSantis, a Republican. Donald Trump has cast his vote during today’s midterm election, with photos captured of him and Melania Trump outside a Florida polling place. Over in Kentucky, Ona Marshall, who is a co-owner of one of the last two abortion clinics left in Kentucky, said the line was overflowing at the polling location where she went to vote today in Louisville, around 11am. “Not even in a presidential year have we seen that number of people, and this is mid-morning,” she said. Of course, there’s no way of knowing whether those voters were out in favor of or against Amendment 2, the ballot proposal looking to restrict abortion in Kentucky. But Marshall said she is hopeful. “Whatever happens, for our country and democracy, it’s extremely important that we have a higher turnout at the polls for every election, so to see it in a midterm election is definitely hopeful,” she said. Maggie Acosta, an organizer door-knocking for Democratic candidates with the hospitality union Unite Here, noted she has heard from many fellow Arizonans who are outraged over the supreme court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v Wade. “Instead of going forward, I’m being pushed back,” Acosta said. “So it’s time that we stand up and fight for what we deserve.” The results of today’s election could have sweeping implications for abortion access in Arizona, which has a pre-Roe abortion ban still on the books. If Democratic gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs cannot win today, Republican lawmakers may move to enforce that law, which has become the subject of court battles. Vice-President Kamala Harris touched on those stakes yesterday, when she participated in a virtual reception with Unite Here organizers. Acosta had the chance to pose a question to Harris, and she asked the vice-president for her message to young women who are devastated by the end of Roe. “Know your power,” Harris replied. “So many of our movements that have been about progress have been led by young leaders, and we need them now. We need them to lead.” Carlisa Johnson reports for the Guardian in Georgia: Georgia voters will decide between Democrat Stacey Abrams and the incumbent Republican governor, Brian Kemp. This race has received immense national attention as it set the stage for the rematch of Abrams and Kemp this election season. However, the gubernatorial race isn’t the only race receiving national attention. Georgia’s Senate race could determine which party holds power next year in the nation’s capital. Current Senator Raphael Warnock is facing off against controversial Republican candidate Herschel Walker. Coleman Williams, a voter in Avondale Estates, Georgia, said he feels the weight of this election as a Georgia voter. “I’ve watched the debates, and there’s just so much at stake for everyone,” said Williams. “I’m feeling nervous but hopeful because Georgia knows that we have to get out there, and we clearly have.” Maggie Acosta has been knocking on the doors of her Arizona neighbors for months, trying to convince them to support Democrats in the midterm elections. Acosta, a member of the hospitality union Unite Here, has participated in campaign work since 2017, and she said the stakes feel particularly high this time around. “This is very important – not only for me, but for my future, my kids, my grandchild,” Acosta said. This election cycle, Unite Here’s organizers have been on the ground in four battleground states – Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and Pennsylvania. Collectively, the union’s members have knocked on 2.7 million doors, including 750,000 in Acosta’s home state of Arizona. Unite Here’s work builds on their momentum from 2020, when the union knocked on 3 million doors after developing a contactless canvassing plan to keep organizers safe from coronavirus. Acosta, a cancer survivor, had her concerns about door-knocking in 2020, but she chose to do so in part because of her outrage over Republicans’ handling of the pandemic. Now she has returned to her post, in the hopes of electing Senator Mark Kelly and gubernatorial candidate Katie Hobbs, both of whom are locked in closely contested races. “No house is going to be left unknocked,” Acosta said. “I feel like being out there and talking to people face to face is the only way that we’re going to make a difference.” Typically, a party’s soul searching begins after the polls close and the results are in. But not this year. Democrats, anticipating heavy losses after a seesaw election season, were already pointing fingers. It began weeks ago. In an op-ed for the Guardian, Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, the party’s progressive standard-bearer, blamed Democrats for failing to deliver a strong economic message that addresses the pocketbook concerns of most Americans. “In my view,” he wrote, “it would be political malpractice for Democrats to ignore the state of the economy and allow Republican lies and distortions to go unanswered.” Meanwhile, many top Democrats say their party mishandled the issue of crime and public safety. Stanley Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster, argued in the American Prospect that the party had badly mishandled the issue of crime and public safety, writing that the 2022 midterms would be remembered “as a toxic campaign, but an effective one in labeling Democrats as ‘pro-crime.’” But others say Democrats’ challengers are much deeper. A policy memo released on the eve of the election, the centrist Democratic think-tank Third Way concluded that the party’s brand had become toxic to swing voters. “Despite a roster of GOP candidates who are extreme by any standard, voters see Democrats as just as extreme, as well as far less concerned about the issues that most worry them,” it stated. Progressives wholeheartedly disagree. A pre-election memo from the Working Families Party national director, Maurice Mitchell, credits progressives for pushing Biden to deliver on key parts of his economic agenda. “Democrats’ passing big and popular legislation and Republican extremism have kept many races much closer than the normal midterm patterns would dictate,” Mitchell wrote. But he warned: “If Democrats face significant losses, those failures of governance and the Democrats who blocked a pro-working-class agenda will bear much of the blame.” It’s just after 12pm here in New York, which means that voting is well under way in most places across the country. Here’s a look at what’s happening at polling locations across the US. In Columbus, Ohio, Jeffrey Weisman voted for the bestselling author and Republican candidate for the US Senate, JD Vance. But not with great enthusiasm. “I vote Republican pretty much all the way and that is my main reason why,” he said. Vance has a slim lead over his Democratic rival, Tim Ryan, in a state that has come to give large majorities to Republican candidates. The tight race in part reflects the strength of Ryan’s campaign for a seat that may decide whether Democrats retain control of the Senate. But it’s also a reflection of voter doubts about Vance’s sincerity after he dramatically shifted from slagging off Trump as a “fraud” and a “moral disaster” to becoming a fervent supporter in order to win his endorsement in the Republican primaries. Weisman, who owns a retail jewellery store, said it didn’t matter that Vance was endorsed by former president Donald Trump. “I like the Republicans’ stuff when it comes more to the economy. I’m a business owner and I feel that things are not going in the right direction with the Democrats in charge. I’m hoping that maybe the Republicans in charge will get things going a little better economy wise,” he said. Weisman twice voted for Trump in the presidential elections. But with the former president apparently on the brink of announcing another run for the White House, Weisman would prefer he stayed out. “It’s a tough one. I like his politics. His mouth scares a lot of people. So I personally do not think he can win because of the mouth, the controversialness of him. And so I think that would be a tough road for him,” he said. Dani Anguiano is reporting for the Guardian in Las Vegas: The fate of the Senate could lie in the hands of voters in Nevada where incumbent Democrat Catherine Cortez Masto is locked in a close race with Adam Laxalt, the Republican former state attorney general who aided in efforts to overturn Joe Biden’s victory in the state. The contest between Cortez Masto, the first Latina senator and successor to the late Democratic leader Harry Reid, and Laxalt has been neck and neck. Laxalt has received the endorsement of Donald Trump, the NRA and Ron DeSantis, while Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and 14 members of Laxalt’s family have backed Cortez Masto. The race, said to be among the closest of this year’s contests, is crucial for Democrats to maintain control of the Senate. Laxalt has sought to appeal to voters by focusing on the economy, which more than one in four voters have said is the most important issue facing the state, and tying Cortez Masto to Joe Biden, who has low approval rates in Nevada. Democrats rallying for the senator have critisized Laxalt for his opposition to reproductive freedom and argued he is in the pocket of big oil as the state sees record high gas prices. “So you see, gas prices going up, grocery prices going up – that takes a bite out of your paycheck. It’s no joke. It hurts. The question, though, you should be asking is – who’s going to actually try to do something about it?” Obama said at an event for Cortez Masto. “She hasn’t forgotten where she came from. Which is why she’s gone after big oil for high gas prices, why she takes on pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug costs.” Cortez Masto has the backing of the local Culinary Workers Union, which is running a campaign to knock on one million doors by election day. Canvassers with the union say the voters they talk to are concerned about growing housing costs and inflation. “Everyone is working side hustles to be able to live a normal life,” said Arlett Tovar, a canvasser with the union. “Vegas used to be such a great affordable place to live and it’s not anymore.” Sam Levine is reporting for the Guardian in Detroit, Michigan: I’m here at Greater Grace temple, a polling site in north-west Detroit. About 400-500 people have voted here so far, the polling site manager told me. Many voters have already cast their ballots by mail, the manager said. There were some glitches with the e-poll books used to check in voters this morning, but those have been fixed. Among other issues, the system was showing that some voters had already cast a mail-in ballot. She also said there haven’t been any incidents involving intimidation or poll watchers, which has been a big concern in Michigan. Xhosoli Nmumhad, 35, said she’s only voted twice before, once in 2008 and then again in 2012 for Barack Obama. But she said she kept seeing political commercials on television and was motivated to vote on Tuesday to support a constitutional amendment on the ballot that would dramatically expand voting rights in Michigan. “I believe everyone should be able to vote,” she said. Ruth Draines, 72, another voter here, said she always voted in elections. This cycle, she said she was motivated by another proposal on the ballot that would amend the state constitution to protect access to abortion. “I don’t like the fact that they want to take away a woman’s right. Because some women get raped and they don’t want to be reminded of that,” she said. So basically that’s one of the big motivator.” Draines said she wasn’t particularly concerned this cycle about efforts to overturn the election. “I think that’s all just hype,” she said. She added that she thinks Michigan’s governor, Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat on the ballot for re-election today, has been doing a “pretty good job”. “I just hopes she keeps up the good work,” she said. Residents of a New Orleans suburb who were casting ballots for the midterm elections Tuesday were navigating more than their fair share of hurdles to exercise their right to vote. A bomb threat to a school in Kenner, Louisiana, which was a polling site for a couple of precincts in the city of about 65,000 people, on Tuesday morning forced vote workers to relocate the site, John Tobler – a spokesperson for the state’s top elections official – told the Guardian. The threat to the Kenner Discovery school displaced the polling site set up there to the campus of Audubon elementary about a mile and a half away, Tobler said. Kenner’s police chief, Keith Conley, confirmed to the Guardian that officers were investigating a bomb threat to Kenner Discovery, which was closed for class to allow to the school to serve as a polling site. But officials said there was no indication the threat, which affected more than 2,500 voters across two precincts, was politically motivated. Louisiana’s top elections official, the secretary of state R Kyle Ardoin, said the early findings of an investigation into the threat suggested the motive was unrelated to politics. Conley added that it was the second similar threat to Kenner Discovery in the last five days. Local reports said the earlier threat on 3 November – which came in when there were no election-related activities at the school – demanded payment in the form of the cryptocurrency Bitcoin. Though it has a significant population of Black and Latino residents, Kenner’s white majority tends to overwhelmingly side with Republican political candidates. Much of the city – including the Kenner Discovery polling site – sits in the congressional district of the Republican House whip, Steve Scalise, who is projected to cruise to re-election in Tuesday’s midterms. Officials nationwide have been concerned about political violence in general in recent years after cases such as the US Capitol insurrection on 6 January 2021 and the attack that left House speaker Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul Pelosi, critically injured on 28 October. Tuesday’s threat at Kenner Discovery came after Ardoin’s office announced that a mobile app, an online portal and a telephone hotline containing polling place and ballot information for Louisiana voters were all “experiencing technical difficulties” within hours of the polls opening Tuesday. Ardoin, a Republican, later said the technical issues had been resolved. Carlisa Johnson reports for the Guardian in Georgia: In Georgia, election day has started without issue. Voters are experiencing limited wait times across the state as they vote in person. Many attribute this to the record-breaking early voting the state saw last month. Still, Georgia’s polling locations are seeing a steady stream of concerned voters making their voices heard in this critical election. Georgia’s secretary of state reports that Georgians are accessing their voter information in record numbers. This morning, voters accessed their “My Voter Page” – which confirms a voter’s registration and polling location – on the Secretary of State website at a rate of 19,215 users a minute. SB202, Georgia’s new election law, eliminated access to provisional ballots for voters who go to the wrong polling location on election day. Voting advocates throughout the state are working diligently to remind voters of this change and the importance of confirming their polling locations. Mariah Headman is a Dekalb county resident and a Georgia teacher. While she has voted absentee in the past, voting in person on election day was more convenient for her this year. She says she is voting with her students in mind. “For me, voting means the difference between well-funded public schools or underfunded ones,” said Headman. “This election is huge, and Georgia has to pull through.” Outside a voting station at the largest Greek Orthodox church in Ohio, Ashley Sica said her vote for the Democrat Tim Ryan in the election for the US Senate was decided by the US supreme court ruling striking down abortion as a constitutional right. “I voted based off of my values, and maybe not necessarily what I would do, but just thinking globally of choices that other people should be able to have. I don’t think that government officials should be in charge what people do with their own bodies,” she said. Sica, a nurse, said that the removal of the right to abortion motivated a lot of women to vote in the midterms who might not usually turn out. Sica said she was also frightened by the Republicans’ blocking of tighter gun control laws even after a series of school massacres. “My children’s daycare is just a mile from here. There was an issue with someone shooting a gun around their daycare. So that’s another thing that kind of brought me out to vote for stricter laws in regards to guns. Having kids that are of school age now really brings that kind of thing into focus, thinking about their safety and the safety of others,” she said. The US Senate election in Pennsylvania is expected to be one of the closest in the country, as John Fetterman, the state’s Democratic lieutenant governor, takes on Mehmet Oz, a Republican celebrity doctor. Fetterman held a commanding lead in the polls for months, but in the days ahead of the vote Mehmet Oz has closed the gap, and the race appears to be a toss-up. Fetterman had a stroke in May, and continues to have issues with speaking and processing the spoken word – something that was laid bare in a difficult debate performance two weeks ago. Fetterman and his team have insisted he is fit and able to work, but his health and recovery has been cruelly mocked by Oz’s campaign. “I liked Fetterman, except for the man had a stroke,” said Steve Schwartz, who had just cast his vote for Oz in Beaver county, 30 miles north-west of Pittsburgh. “I don’t even know if he can drive to work yet. You don’t wanna hire him and then he’s going to be on disability for a little bit. I don’t think his health allows him to do what he’s doing right now.” Schwartz, who also voted for the Republican candidates for governor and the US House, said he would have “seriously considered” Fetterman, were it not for the stroke. Beaver county, named after the Beaver River, which is named after either the Lenape chief King Beaver or the animal the beaver, voted for Trump in 2020 and 2016, but Trump’s margin of victory was smaller here than in other counties. Mike Moore, a 41-year-old loan closer, said he had voted for Fetterman for Senate. “I like the way he is, I’ve met him a couple of times, he seems like a real genuine guy. I kind of don’t like Dr. Oz, because he doesn’t live in Pennsylvania – and that’s kind of like: ‘How can he represent me?’” Moore said, referencing Oz’s long-term residency in New Jersey. Oz lived in a mansion in New Jersey for decades, but has said he moved to Pennsylvania in late 2020. The most important issue for Moore, he said, was “bipartisanship”, something that seems unlikely to spring from this midterm cycle. “This country is so polarized now, it’s a shame. You know, we got to work together. We got to be Americans.” This midterm election is already the most expensive in history, and depending on how today goes, it could get even more pricey. Spending on this election season has exceeded $16.7bn across federal and local candidates – over $2bn more than the 2018 midterms. Federal candidates have spent over $8.9bn while state candidates, party committees and ballot measure committees have spent $7.8bn, according to OpenSecrets, which tracks campaign spending. The arrival of election day doesn’t mean the spending will stop, especially if runoff elections have to take place. The race for a Georgia Senate seat between incumbent Raphael Warnock and Herschel Walker – a race that has been riddled with controversy – could lead to a runoff in December if neither candidate gets over 50% of the vote. Both parties have already spent over $241m on the race – what the Wall Street Journal calculated is $30.83 for each of the state’s 7.8 million registered voters. In Ohio, one of the most important races for Republican leaders is to take full control of the state supreme court. Control because candidates for the bench run not on their judicial qualifications but on party tickets with an implicit commitment to make decisions in line with their political values. Republicans have technically controlled the court since 1986, holding four of the seven seats. But one of the judges, the outgoing chief justice, Maureen O’Connor, is widely regarded by the party leadership as having gone rogue by siding with Democrats in some politically sensitive cases including over gerrymandering. And now the highly contentious issues of abortion is likely to be on the agenda following the US supreme court decision overturning Roe v Wade. The three conservative candidates, already on the court and seeking reelection, in recent days joined a Republican bus campaign tour alongside the party’s contenders for the US Senate and state governor. No separation of powers there. At a stop in Columbus, one of the judges, Pat Fischer, told a rally that it was important to keep the court out of the hands of “activist judges that are Democrats”. Not activist judges as such, just ones who are Democrats. “It’s critical that the three of us win this race and we go back to having a conservative Ohio supreme court,” he told the rally. The new state supreme court is expected to decide whether to let stand the state’s ban on abortion beyond six weeks of pregnancy, brought in after Roe v Wade was overturned. A lower court blocked the measure last month. Although the three Republican contenders for the court all say they will apply the law and not political judgements, each has already made clear their opposition to abortion. Another of the Republican judges, Sharon Kennedy, is running to become chief justice. She has indicated that she would not enforce previous court rulings to stop Ohio’s Republican legislature from gerrymandering elections. The Florida state department sent a letter to the US Department of Justice saying that federal election monitors won’t be permitted inside the state’s polling places. Florida’s state department said that the monitors “would be counterproductive and could potentially undermine confidence in the election”. The justice department regularly sends monitors to states on Election Day in an attempt to curb voter intimidation at polling places. Yesterday, the department said it would send out workers to 64 jurisdictions across 24 states. In 2020, the department sent out workers to 44 jurisdictions. The states include key swing districts in Arizona, Michigan and Pennsylvania. “Monitors will include personnel from the Civil Rights Division and from US attorneys’ offices,” the department said in a statement. Florida’s state department said the DOJ did not “detail the need for federal monitors” in the state. “None of the counties are currently subject to any election-related federal consent decrees. None of the counties have been accused of violating the rights of language or racial minorities or of the elderly or disabled,” the letter said. While Louisiana isn’t expected to see many surprises during today’s midterm elections, voters there were among those enduring technical difficulties to cast their ballots. The secretary of state, R Kyle Ardoin, Louisiana’s top election official, said a mobile app, an online portal and a telephone hotline containing polling place and ballot information were all “experiencing technical difficulties” within hours of the polls opening Tuesday. Ardoin, a Republican, by midday said the technical problems had been resolved. Before the issues were taken care of, Ardoin had directed residents to call the registrar of voters office in their parish – which is the term Louisiana uses for county – or to email his office at elections@sos.la.gov to ask any necessary questions. Ardoin’s announcement came after officials in Virginia reported technical difficulties with equipment that verifies’ voter information and poll staff in Texas said they were having problems with check-in machines. The Republican party’s whip in the US House of Representatives, Steve Scalise, is among those up for re-election in Louisiana on Tuesday. So is Republican US Senator John N Kennedy. Both are expected to cruise to re-election. Outside the Eastern high school athletic club in Lansing, Michigan on a small patch of neatly trimmed grass, Elissa Slotkin – a congresswoman running in the most expensive house race in the country, spoke to reporters. She cast her vote alongside a steady stream of voters around 9am. Slotkin seemed disturbed but prepared for attempts already being made to undermine election results in Michigan – on Monday, a judge dismissed an attempt by Republicans to toss out votes in Detroit as lacking a “shred of evidence”. “This is what happens when a leadership climate is set in our country, trying to undercut democracy when one side loses. It’s unclear what my opponent will do if he loses. The good news is, we’ve seen this movie before – in 2020 – we were prepared,” said Slotkin. She said it was undeniable that inflation has been on everybody’s mind in Michigan, but added that ballot initiative to protect abortion in Michigan is a “countervailing wind”. “I was at the Michigan State rally last night with campus organizers, and Roe v Wade is really motivating students,” she said. A few polling places have reported technical issues this morning. The Virginia elections department confirmed that there were issues with polling books, which verifies voters’ information. The department said the issue has been resolved, though one poll worker told Kelly Avellino of local news station NBC12 that they were still have issues with their poll books. In Temple, Texas, some elections staff noticed technical issues with their check-in machines. “At this time, it is possible that some sites will experience delays this morning, but election officials are confident that the problem has been isolated and should be resolved quickly,” James Stafford, a local official, said in a news release. Elections departments are under heavy pressure to ensure smooth sailing at the polls today as some conservatives have essentially said they will fight election results if they lose, taking a page from Donald Trump’s 2020 playbook. Reports of voter and election workers intimidation have also been seen recently, like people video-taping ballot drop-off boxes and tabulation offices in Arizona. An estimated 8.3 million young Americans are eligible to vote for the first time this election. The question remains how many of them – and other young voters – will turn out to the polls. When it comes to younger voters, the stakes are higher for Democrats than Republicans: 57% of young Americans between the ages of 18 and 29 favor a Democrat-controlled Congress over Republican control. But younger voters also tend to vote less than older voters (though more voted in 2020 than ever before). Early data has shown that young voters have been turning out in smaller fractions compared to the 2020 election. But young voters are less likely to vote early or by mail, so it’s too early to tell exactly what their turnout will be today. Still, amid the uncertainty, some young voters have already visited the polls today. One mom in Georgia, Christy Houchins, an immigrant from Laos who became a citizen, brought her daughter to the polls today, according to Greg Bluestein of the Atlanta Journal Constitution. This is Lauren Aratani taking over for Martin Belam. More polls have opened up around the country, and many voters have already casted their ballots this morning. Here are some pictures that have been taken at polling places around the country as election day gets rolling. In the past, midterm elections have been kind of predictable. The president is slightly unpopular, his party loses some seats and most voters disappear for two years until they turn up in greater numbers for the main show. This year might not buck any of those long-term trends. The Democratic president Joe Biden has watched his popularity slump from 53% to 42% over the past year. Polls suggest that Republicans will win the House of Representatives and might even win the Senate too (though if they do, it’s likely to be by a narrower margin). And even though turnout is looking set to be historically high by midterm standards, it’s unlikely to beat the numbers in 2020. So, it’s all pretty much electoral business as usual, right? Not quite. Here are some of the factors that could shape the votes that come in over the next few days – and, as a result, shape the country over the next few years. Redistricting Under Trump, gerrymandering and other anti-democratic measures scaled up. There have been concerns about the way that kind of partisan redistricting might play out in this year’s elections – where the electoral district is purple, this is likely to work in Republicans’ favor including parts of Texas and Florida. But, as the New York Times pointed out in September, this might not wind up being such a huge advantage for Republicans. While it’s true that the map does work in their favor, the edge isn’t insurmountable for Democrats (and it certainly isn’t irreversible either). Restrictions In the space of just six months, 22 new laws were passed in 2021 that restricted people’s access to vote in 14 states. Research from the Brennan centre has indicated that voter suppression is at its worst level in over a decade. Whether those laws make it hard to count mail-in ballots or make it difficult to vote in person, their overall effect tends to disenfranchise those who are already disempowered by other systems in the country – whether it’s people with disabilities or people of color who are more likely to be affected by voter ID laws. It’s also worth pointing out that laws like these are uncommon in most other countries that call themselves democracies. Republicans have led these efforts in the hopes that voter access laws will work in their favor. Abortion and the economy Sure, there are the same ideological arguments about immigration and the economy that show up in any election but this year feels different. There is a general atmosphere of distrust fueled by attacks on election officials and lies about “stolen” ballots that has led some to feel that they are voting about democracy itself. And, since the supreme court’s 1973 Roe v Wade decision was overturned in June, this year’s vote has for many felt like a vote about abortion access. Even the economy has taken on a greater urgency than in recent midterms with rising consumer prices squeezing many US household budgets. Lastly, polling is still deeply problematic so all predictions about the House and the Senate should be treated with caution until the votes are counted. A Wall Street Journal survey that found white suburban women are switching parties was based on just 297 respondents (which, shockingly, is actually a pretty good response rate for such a specific slice of the country). That kind of research is not only imprecise but it has the potential to be undemocratic when headlines tell voters what the future looks like before they have even had their say. Read more of Mona Chalabi’s analysis here: Officials in Philadelphia have said that counting votes will take longer than expected after a last minute u-turn to reinstate what is known as poll book reconciliation. The process, described as “time consuming and labor-intensive” by the Philadelphia Inquirer, is used to flag mail ballots submitted by voters who also voted in person. City officials had agreed last week not to use it, but following a flurry of Republican lawsuits at an emergency meeting this morning just as polls opened, they reversed the decision. It could have an impact on how quickly the Pennsylvania senate race can be called. Jason Lange is in Washington for Reuters and he has a warning – be ready for a long night and maybe days of waiting before it is clear whether Republicans or President Joe Biden’s Democrats will control Congress. He reports that with dozens of races expected to be close and key states like Pennsylvania already warning it could take days to count every ballot, experts say there’s a good chance America goes to bed on election night without knowing who won. “When it comes to knowing the results, we should move away from talking about election day and think instead about election week,” said Nathan Gonzales, who publishes the nonpartisan newsletter Inside Elections. Because Democrats vote by mail more often than Republicans, states that let officials get an early jump on counting mail ballots could report big Democratic leads early on that evaporate as vote counters work through piles of Republican-leaning ballots that were cast on election day. In these “blue mirage” states - which include Florida and North Carolina - election officials are allowed to remove mail ballots from their envelopes before election day and load them in vote counting machines, allowing for speedy counting. States including Pennsylvania and Wisconsin don’t allow officials to open the envelopes until election day, leading to a possible “red mirage” in which Republican-leaning election day ballots are reported earlier, with many Democratic-leaning mail ballots counted later. Experts like Joe Lenski, co-founder of Edison Research, which will be tracking hundreds of races on Tuesday and supplying Reuters and other media organizations with results, will keep an eye on the mix of different types of ballots each state is counting throughout the night. “Blue mirage, red mirage, whatever. You just have to look at what types of votes are getting reported to know where you are in that state,” said Lenski. A number of candidates will make history if they prevail in their races today. In particular, the departure of 46 members from the House of Representatives has created an opening for a new class of young and diverse candidates to seek federal office. Two House candidates, Democrat Maxwell Frost of Florida and Republican Karoline Leavitt of New Hampshire, would become the first Gen Z members of Congress if they win their elections. Leavitt would also set a record as the youngest woman ever elected to Congress if she can defeat Democrat Chris Pappas in their hotly contested race, which is considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report. In Vermont, Democrat Becca Balint is favored to win her House race, which would make her the first woman and the first openly LGBTQ+ politician to represent the state in Congress. If Balint wins, all 50 US states will have sent at least one woman to Congress, as Vermont became the sole outlier on that metric in 2018. Some House races will even make history regardless of which party’s candidate prevails. In New York’s third congressional district, either Democrat Robert Zimmerman or Republican George Devolder-Santos will become the first openly gay person to represent Long Island in the House. As Republicans look to take back the House, their playbook has relied upon nominating a diverse slate of candidates in battleground districts that will probably determine control of the lower chamber. The strategy builds upon the party’s momentum from 2020, when Republicans flipped 14 House districts where they nominated a woman or a person of color. Overall, Republicans have nominated 67 candidates of color in House races, according to the National Republican Congressional Committee. Those candidates could allow the party to dramatically expand its ranks of members of color, given that just 19 non-white Republicans serve in the House now. With Republicans heavily favored to take back the House, many of those candidates of color could join the new session of Congress in January. Read more of Joan E Greve’s report here: Midterm elections – the candidates who will make history if they win Here are some of the earliest images we’ve been sent over the newswires of people voting in-person as polling gets underway in today’s crucial midterm elections in the US. Paul J Webber and Acacia Coronado have been in Austin, Texas for Associated Press, and report on a trio of US House races in South Texas which carry high stakes. For decades Republicans rarely bothered to compete along the US-Mexico border, but have made the heavily Hispanic region a priority in their pursuit of retaking control of Congress. The unusually competitive atmosphere in South Texas, including for Democratic US Rep Henry Cuellar, underlines the shifting political winds in an important stronghold for Democrats — and the ramifications beyond this election. For Republicans, victories by any of three Latina candidates running for House seats in the region — Rep Mayra Flores, Monica De La Cruz and Cassy Garcia — would deepen inroads the Republican party is making nationally with Hispanic voters, and demoralise Democrats in a place that has long been their turf. In a sign of Republican optimism, Gov Greg Abbott was hosting his Election Night party in the border city of McAllen, reflecting Republican eagerness to show conservatives are expanding their territory. The Republicans unleashed an aggressive play for South Texas after counties up and down the border swung toward former president Donald Trump in 2020, stunning Democrats who viewed the region safe and creating a new battleground overnight. Millions of dollars have since poured into the region, and all three Republican House candidates out-raised their Democratic opponents this summer. Underscoring the intensity of the races heading into Tuesday, former president Bill Clinton swung through South Texas on Monday to campaign for the Democratic party. Big-name Republicans have also swooped into the region, including House minority leader Kevin McCarthy over the weekend. The most widely seen competitive race was in the 15th Congressional District, where De La Cruz and Democrat Michelle Vallejo were competing to represent one of the two new US House districts that Texas was awarded last year following the release of new census figures. Neither candidate was running to the middle with their policy platforms. De La Cruz has defended abortion restrictions, promised tougher border security measures and drew praise from Trump during a recent rally in Texas. Vallejo has courted liberal voters in a progressive campaign that has called for a $15 an hour minimum wage and challenged conventional wisdom that Democrats along the border are more moderate. Andrew Gawthorpe is a historian of the United States at Leiden University and host of the podcast America Explained, and he writes for the Guardian today to argue that the future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections: Never before in American history has there been an organized movement which was only one vote away from having the motivation and opportunity to make that election America’s last. Never that is, until now. Today’s anti-democratic movement is propelled not by genuine controversy or scandal, but rather by their commitment to ending competitive elections in the United States. There is no other way to interpret their belief that only one side, the Republicans, can legitimately be considered to win, and the plans that they hold to make this belief a reality. The problems can be expected to start this November, when Republican candidates who lose will question the validity of the results and try to stir unrest. State officials who do win will begin to act on their plans to sabotage future polls by centralizing power in their own offices, de-registering millions of voters, and moving to error-prone hand-counting systems. Then, if voter suppression doesn’t prevent a Democratic win in 2024, they’ll just suppress the evidence instead and announce that they are sending Republican electors to the electoral college. Meanwhile, the majority of Republican House candidates in 2022 are election-deniers, and a Republican-controlled Congress might attempt to sabotage the certification of the presidential vote on 6 January 2025. Each of these potential points of failure threatens the integrity of the 2024 presidential election. The breadth and depth of the anti-democratic movement also means that they are likely to pose other problems which are difficult to anticipate. Whatever means they find of sabotaging the vote, it would be foolish to rely on the conservative-dominated supreme court to stop them, particularly if the country has been plunged into civil unrest and violence. Read more here: Andrew Gawthorpe – The future of American democracy is at stake in the midterm elections If you would like something to listen to about the US midterm elections, then Today in Focus is for you. Today’s edition is called US midterms: is it still the economy, stupid? and it features the Guardian’s Washington correspondent Lauren Gambino talking to Michael Safi. She tells him that the Democratic party has learned the hard way to keep its election campaigns laser-focused on the economy. “It’s the economy, stupid,” a slogan used in Bill Clinton’s 1992 campaign, has resonated down the ages. But Democrats have spent much of the past few months campaigning on women’s rights after the seismic supreme court decision removing the constitutional right to abortion. And Joe Biden used his final major speech of the campaign to warn voters of the threat to democracy itself. Democrats go into these elections lagging in the polls, she says, and it’s left some hardened campaigners, such as Bernie Sanders, wondering if the party has neglected its most famous mantra. You can listen to it here: Joe Biden had a late night last night, after appearing at a rally in Maryland, where he said “Our lifetimes are going to be shaped by what happens the next year to three years. It’s going to shape what the next couple decades look like.” Joan E Greve was in Bowie, Maryland for the Guardian, and reported that Biden repeated his promise to shore up abortion rights if Democrats expand their congressional majorities. The president and his wife, Dr Jill Biden, arrived back at the White House at around 1.20am. The Philadelphia Inquirer this morning has been touting a series of quotes from voters in the area which highlight the different priorities of Republican and Democratic party voters. Here are four quotes that they picked for their newsletter today: “It feels like a critical time. We’ve got to pick a path, and the path that we’re on is not right,” Nate DeFazio, a small business owner worried about inflation, said outside of a Mehmet Oz rally. “If we do not maintain a majority in the Senate, Roe falling will be just the beginning,” Ronna Dewey, 54, said at a John Fetterman rally. “It’s really important to me to be able to graduate high school and enter adulthood in a state of having all my rights intact and not feeling like, ‘Oh, I wish I’d graduated 10 years ago,’” said Jordan Bailkin, a Democratic high school senior who is voting for the first time. “Personal freedom and the freedom to dissent – I feel that both of those things are under attack,” Jason Dekker, a conservative from York County said. Overnight Stephen Collinson at CNN offered this analysis of how – and why – he expects things to pan out in favor of the Republicans in the next few days. He writes: It’s too early for postmortems. Forty million Americans have already voted. And the uncertainty baked into modern polling means no one can be sure a red wave is coming. Democrats could still cling onto the Senate even if the House falls. But the way each side is talking on election eve, and the swathe of blue territory – from New York to Washington state – that Democrats are defending offer a clear picture of Republican momentum. A nation split down the middle politically, which is united only by a sense of dissatisfaction with its trajectory, is getting into a habit of repeatedly using elections to punish the party with the most power. That means Democrats are most exposed this time. If the president’s party takes a drubbing, there will be much Democratic finger-pointing over Biden’s messaging strategy on inflation – a pernicious force that has punched holes in millions of family budgets. Just as in last year’s losing off-year gubernatorial race in Virginia, Democrats are closing the campaign warning about democracy and Trump’s influence while Republicans believe they are addressing the issue voters care about most. We probably won’t know the winners on election night In many races, we’re not going to know who won on election night. After the polls close, candidate vote totals are likely to shift as local officials continue to count ballots. Once the polls close, election workers tabulate the votes in each precinct and transmit them to the county’s central election office. Each county reports their results to the state. Vote totals are likely to shift throughout the evening as well as in the days that follow election day as votes continue to be counted. That shift isn’t unusual and can be explained by two dynamics, said Charles Stewart III, a political science professor at MIT who specializes in election administration. First, he said, the places that report their votes first tend to be smaller, Republican jurisdictions. Second, many places report their in-person election day vote first and their mail-in absentee vote later. Those votes tend to skew towards Democrats. Because these totals can change, there should be deep skepticism of attempts to claim victory before votes are counted. Projections about which candidates will win are separate from official results As officials report election results, news organizations, including the Associated Press and major television networks, scrutinize data to try to make projections about which candidate will win. This process is independent of the official election efforts to count votes. In some races, experts are able to quickly make a projection about who is going to win a race. If a candidate from one party has consistently won a race, for example, and the voting patterns on election night appear to immediately be in line with previous elections, news organizations may feel confident in making a projection with only a fraction of the vote counted. But in competitive races where there’s a slim margin between the candidates, and a lot of the vote hasn’t been reported yet, experts are much more cautious and will not make a prediction. As the vote count continues, forecasters compare the margin separating the candidate with where in the state there are still votes outstanding. Once they feel confident that there’s no path to victory for one candidate, they will declare a winner. Some will claim that they see election errors (and most will turn out to be false) Every election day, there are voters who claim to see something amiss at the polls or during the vote counting process. In 2020, many of those claims were loudly amplified by Donald Trump and continue to live on today, even though they’ve been debunked over and over again. In 2022, we’re likely to hear similar claims. Each one of those should be taken with a “giant grain of salt”, David Becker, the founder and executive director of the Center for Election Innovation and Research, said. “I would look at any claim from anyone saying that, regardless of party of election, highly skeptically. “These things are largely driven by losing candidates or candidates that expect to lose,” he added. The claims, he said, are “almost always proven to be false. Or easily explainable.” In 2020, for example, there were claims from observers about ballots being wheeled into a central counting facility in Detroit late during election night. Those ballots had already been verified by the local election office and there was nothing wrong with their late arrival time. The claim was nonetheless touted by those who sought to sow doubt about the election results. You can read more from Sam Levine’s explainer here: When will we know who won US midterm races — and what to expect on election day If you missed it last night, here is the clip of former US president Donald Trump, speaking at a rally in Ohio, saying he will be making a “big announcement” on 15 November, hinting that he will mount a 2024 presidential run. “I’m going to be making a very big announcement on Tuesday, 15 November at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida,” Trump told supporters at the rally for Republican Senate candidate JD Vance. Trump declined to elaborate, saying he did not want to “detract from tomorrow’s very important, even critical election”. Polls have opened in some parts of the US for the 2022 midterm elections, so called because they fall halfway through a president’s – in this case, Joe Biden’s – presidency and so are often seen as a referendum on the incumbent. Many voters have already cast their ballots, with more than 41 million people taking part in early voting. At stake are all 435 seats in the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the 100-member Senate, 36 state governorships, along with numerous other races for local officials and mayors. Republicans need to gain five seats to win a majority in the House and only one to take the Senate. Typically, an incumbent president’s party expects to lose House seats in the midterms, but this year’s races are being closely watched for any gains for election-denying candidates: Republicans who still believe the lie that Donald Trump won the 2020 presidential election, some of whom actively worked to overturn the result that put Biden in the White House. In 36 states, other issues are on the ballot, including laws on abortion in California, Kentucky, Michigan, Montana and Vermont. We will have all the news and results on our live blog, so stay tuned. Nimo Omer spoke to David Smith, the Guardian’s Washington DC bureau chief, about why these midterms matter so much and what the results could mean for America: There are a number of contests that everyone is keeping a very close eye on. Perhaps the biggest is Georgia: “The rule used to be whichever way Florida goes, so goes the nation,” says David, but “Georgia has, in many ways, replaced Florida as the pivotal state in the nation.” Georgia’s senate race is extremely important. Raphael Warnock’s win in 2021 was key to the Democrats securing control of the senate. Now Warnock faces off against Herschel Walker, a former football player who “has no discernible political experience or qualifications”, David says. Walker has been embroiled in controversy for a year as stories of his affairs, extramarital children and allegations of domestic violence came to light. Most recently, a former girlfriend asserted that he paid for for her to have an abortion, despite Walker running on a hardline anti-abortion platform. And Georgia is also where Democratic favourite (and Star Trek’s president of a United Earth), Stacey Abrams, will again try to wrestle the governership from Brian Kemp. A victory for Abrams would ensure voting and abortion rights are bolstered in the state. Other races to watch out for are Ohio, where author of Hillbilly Elegy, Trump critic turned sycophant JD Vance is running: “If Democrats win in a state that has really been trending Republican in recent years, there’ll be a lot of blame on Vance and perhaps Donald Trump for backing him,” David says. Pennsylvania, home of Joe Biden, is another crucial state with TV personality Dr Mehmet Oz running against the 6’8” tattooed lieutenant governor, John Fetterman, in the senate race. Oz secured a Trump endorsement, as did Doug Mastriano, who is running for governor of the same state. Mastriano was part of the effort to overturn the 2020 elections and appeared outside the US Capitol during January 6 riots. He could be a key part of a Trump presidential run in 2024. “It feels as if there are two separate campaigns and conversations happening, that are operating on different planets,” David says. “In the past, at least, there was a shared set of issues, and both parties would be looking to be the best on inflation or healthcare.” Republicans have focused on inflation, specifically petrol prices, and the cost of living crisis. They have also made characteristic campaign points about crime and other culture war topics such as immigration. Conversely, Democrats have been focused on reproductive rights following the supreme court decision to overturn Roe v Wade, as well as the threats to democracy, voting rights and the climate crisis. “A lot of opinion polls are suggesting that Republicans’ issues are likely to win the day, because so often, people vote according to their pocketbook and the economy,” says David. Read more of Nimo Omer’s conversation with David Smith in today’s First Edition: Tuesday briefing – What you need to know ahead of US midterms Hello and welcome to our coverage of the US midterm elections. As my colleague Nimo Omer wrote in today’s First Edition newsletter, ballots will be cast for senators, representatives and local officials in one of the most important contests in recent years. She added that it has become tiresome to describe every American election as uniquely significant, but there is a lot at stake with these midterms as the chasm between Democrats and Republicans grows ever wider, and the supreme court decision to no longer protect abortion rights hangs in the air. The result of the election also has global implications, as concerns are expressed that a Republican win might dampen US enthusiasm for pouring financial and military aid into Ukraine’s war for survival against the latest Russia invasion of its territory. And the outcome will set the stage for the presidential election battle to come during the next two years – a race which looks likely now to feature a certain Donald J Trump. We will have non-stop rolling live coverage of the election over the next couple of days, so I hope you will join us.","charCount":"90631","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/gloria-oladipo\">Gloria Oladipo</a>, <a href=\"profile/lauren-aratani\">Lauren Aratani</a> and <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"politics/2022/nov/08/justice-for-gav-williamson-devotees-rally-behind-britains-finest-fireplace-salesman","type":"article","sectionId":"politics","sectionName":"Politics","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-08T20:21:49Z","webTitle":"Williamson devotees rally behind Britain’s finest fireplace salesman but Gav goes – again","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/nov/08/justice-for-gav-williamson-devotees-rally-behind-britains-finest-fireplace-salesman","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/politics/2022/nov/08/justice-for-gav-williamson-devotees-rally-behind-britains-finest-fireplace-salesman","fields":{"headline":"Williamson devotees rally behind Britain’s finest fireplace salesman but Gav goes – again","standfirst":"<p>The much-sacked cabinet minister was clearly the right person for the job.

Nor could she see why he was also sacked as education secretary just because he made a complete mess of the exams system. Still, it had been the proudest day of her life when she finally got to knight him. Arise, Sir Gav.</p> <p>The King thought back to his last conversation with his mother. How she had implored him to intercede with whoever happened to be prime minister that week – even she was struggling to keep up – to get justice for Gav. The least he deserved was another cabinet job. Even if no one, including Gav, really knew what he was meant to be doing. The royal family, better than most, knew the value of non-jobs.</p> <p>So when Rishi Sunak became prime minister, Charles had been happy to put a good word in. A last act of duty to the Queen from a devoted son. To the King’s surprise, it had been like pushing at an open door. Rish! had been been only too happy to insist that Gav’s reputation as a total liability, who could only be depended on to be the most untrustworthy and unpleasant person in any room, was entirely undeserved. The fact you couldn’t find anyone to admit they hadn’t been bullied by Gav proved it was all a plot.</p> <p>It would be an honour to have someone whom even Boris Johnson had been obliged to sack back in the cabinet. Not out of weakness. Far from it. Everyone knew that Rish! had never needed to make any grubby deals to ensure his coronation as prime minister.</p> <p>No. It was from a position of strength. Gav was clearly the right person for the job. Whatever that job happened to be. He’d work out those kind of details later. For now it was just nice to have Gav back around the place. Minister without portfolio. To convey the right “Don’t give a toss” attitude to the cost of living crisis. Gav was a man made for levitas.</p> <p>Perhaps in time, Rish! had thought, he would find something for Gav to do. Minister for making everyone feel good about being British. Minister for something to do with national security: that would give him something to leak. Minister for government press officers – or minister for bullying, as it was otherwise known. That would do. Not that Gav was a bully. Just a bit high-spirited and excitable. Someone who couldn’t help getting priapic at his proximity to power. Someone whose sense of humour was to take whipping literally.</p> <p>So Gav had told the chief whip to fuck off. To stop pussing him about. That was just everyday bantz. And he had told a senior civil servant at the ministry of defence to slit his throat. That had been an act of kindness. He had simply thought the person had been choking on a crisp and was merely suggesting an emergency tracheotomy. He was trying to save a life.</p> <p>And as for Gav telling someone to jump out the window, that was just a bit of fun. He had never intended anyone to die. Just to get paralysed from the waist down. People should just learn to chill a bit more. So, Rish! wanted everyone to know that Little Gav had his utmost confidence.</p> <p>Up to the point when more evidence emerged that Gav was yet another Billy-No-Mates Bully with a fragile ego. Then Sunak would pretend he had no idea about Gav’s reputation for treating people in an unacceptable manner. And no one had mentioned to him Gav had twice been sacked for disloyalty and incompetence. But if push came to shove, Rish! would sack him in a heartbeat. Anything to protect himself.</p> <p>And so it proved. As it turned out that virtually everyone who had ever worked with Gav had found him irresistibly hateful – to know him is to loathe him – and that the complaints system was in danger of grinding to a halt under the weight of people coming forward to tell their truth, Brave Rish! chose to pull the plug. Third time unlucky. “It’s not me, it’s you,” he had said to a tearful Gav. “One of us has a career to worry about.” Though he might have thought of that sooner. So much for his integrity, professionalism and accountability. In the background you could hear Suella whoop. She could have sworn it should have been her to be the first cabinet minister to be sacked. Two weeks and counting … </p> <p>It was left to cabinet office minister Jeremy Quin – Sunak’s iteration of the unctuous Michael Ellis, who could be sent to the Commons <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2022/jan/11/michael-ellis-bends-down-and-takes-the-party-rap-as-pm-stays-in-hiding\">to defend any irretrievable situation</a> – to try to salvage a shred of decency on behalf of the government. He didn’t succeed. Labour’s shadow home secretary had used a humble address to try to force the government to reveal all the evidence that had been available to the prime minister before handing out cabinet jobs to Suella Braverman and the Gavster. It wasn’t successful, but that was beside the point. What it did was expose the hollow emptiness at the heart of government. The moral vacuum.</p> <p>All Yvette Cooper wanted to see were papers, scraps, anything that would help the country to understand why Leaky Sue and Gav had been given their jobs when they both had a track record both for breaking the ministerial code and being generally useless. Didn’t we deserve something a bit better than this? Apparently not. The Tory party was clean out of talent. So we just had to suck it up. And the government wouldn’t be releasing any documents because… … Just because.</p> <p>Much the same arguments had been used in an earlier opposition day debate in which Labour tried to get the government to commit to the pension triple lock. “Sorry,” said the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride. He couldn’t possibly second guess what was going to be in next week’s autumn budget. Er, right. But it was the Tories who had committed to it in their manifesto. Surely someone ought to be able to confirm whether Sunak was going to do what he had promised? He couldn’t.</p> <p>We were just going to have to wait and see. Live dangerously.

How she had implored him to intercede with whoever happened to be prime minister that week – even she was struggling to keep up – to get justice for Gav. The least he deserved was another cabinet job. Even if no one, including Gav, really knew what he was meant to be doing. The royal family, better than most, knew the value of non-jobs. So when Rishi Sunak became prime minister, Charles had been happy to put a good word in. A last act of duty to the Queen from a devoted son. To the King’s surprise, it had been like pushing at an open door. Rish! had been been only too happy to insist that Gav’s reputation as a total liability, who could only be depended on to be the most untrustworthy and unpleasant person in any room, was entirely undeserved. The fact you couldn’t find anyone to admit they hadn’t been bullied by Gav proved it was all a plot. It would be an honour to have someone whom even Boris Johnson had been obliged to sack back in the cabinet. Not out of weakness. Far from it. Everyone knew that Rish! had never needed to make any grubby deals to ensure his coronation as prime minister. No. It was from a position of strength. Gav was clearly the right person for the job. Whatever that job happened to be. He’d work out those kind of details later. For now it was just nice to have Gav back around the place. Minister without portfolio. To convey the right “Don’t give a toss” attitude to the cost of living crisis. Gav was a man made for levitas. Perhaps in time, Rish! had thought, he would find something for Gav to do. Minister for making everyone feel good about being British. Minister for something to do with national security: that would give him something to leak. Minister for government press officers – or minister for bullying, as it was otherwise known. That would do. Not that Gav was a bully. Just a bit high-spirited and excitable. Someone who couldn’t help getting priapic at his proximity to power. Someone whose sense of humour was to take whipping literally. So Gav had told the chief whip to fuck off. To stop pussing him about. That was just everyday bantz. And he had told a senior civil servant at the ministry of defence to slit his throat. That had been an act of kindness. He had simply thought the person had been choking on a crisp and was merely suggesting an emergency tracheotomy. He was trying to save a life. And as for Gav telling someone to jump out the window, that was just a bit of fun. He had never intended anyone to die. Just to get paralysed from the waist down. People should just learn to chill a bit more. So, Rish! wanted everyone to know that Little Gav had his utmost confidence. Up to the point when more evidence emerged that Gav was yet another Billy-No-Mates Bully with a fragile ego. Then Sunak would pretend he had no idea about Gav’s reputation for treating people in an unacceptable manner. And no one had mentioned to him Gav had twice been sacked for disloyalty and incompetence. But if push came to shove, Rish! would sack him in a heartbeat. Anything to protect himself. And so it proved. As it turned out that virtually everyone who had ever worked with Gav had found him irresistibly hateful – to know him is to loathe him – and that the complaints system was in danger of grinding to a halt under the weight of people coming forward to tell their truth, Brave Rish! chose to pull the plug. Third time unlucky. “It’s not me, it’s you,” he had said to a tearful Gav. “One of us has a career to worry about.” Though he might have thought of that sooner. So much for his integrity, professionalism and accountability. In the background you could hear Suella whoop. She could have sworn it should have been her to be the first cabinet minister to be sacked. Two weeks and counting … It was left to cabinet office minister Jeremy Quin – Sunak’s iteration of the unctuous Michael Ellis, who could be sent to the Commons to defend any irretrievable situation – to try to salvage a shred of decency on behalf of the government. He didn’t succeed. Labour’s shadow home secretary had used a humble address to try to force the government to reveal all the evidence that had been available to the prime minister before handing out cabinet jobs to Suella Braverman and the Gavster. It wasn’t successful, but that was beside the point. What it did was expose the hollow emptiness at the heart of government. The moral vacuum. All Yvette Cooper wanted to see were papers, scraps, anything that would help the country to understand why Leaky Sue and Gav had been given their jobs when they both had a track record both for breaking the ministerial code and being generally useless. Didn’t we deserve something a bit better than this? Apparently not. The Tory party was clean out of talent. So we just had to suck it up. And the government wouldn’t be releasing any documents because… … Just because. Much the same arguments had been used in an earlier opposition day debate in which Labour tried to get the government to commit to the pension triple lock. “Sorry,” said the work and pensions secretary, Mel Stride. He couldn’t possibly second guess what was going to be in next week’s autumn budget. Er, right. But it was the Tories who had committed to it in their manifesto. Surely someone ought to be able to confirm whether Sunak was going to do what he had promised? He couldn’t. We were just going to have to wait and see. Live dangerously.
