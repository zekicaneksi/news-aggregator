He said the “desire to push the bill through at warp speed” shows disrespect to workers and businesses.</p> <p>Dutton said it was “absolutely unprecedented” for the <strong>Fair Work Commission</strong> to be given powers to arbitrate intractable disputes, a move that would “kill off bargaining” and move back towards centralised wage fixing.</p> <p>Dutton claimed there is “no shortage of strike action right now” – which ignores that strikes are at their lowest level in decades – citing the RTBU train strike in Sydney as a sign of things to come. That is exactly the sort of dispute that the FWC is likely to be able to arbitrate, getting trains running again.</p>  <figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"ab65cec8e536851eb2885c2daeea38f7f611fed1\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/ab65cec8e536851eb2885c2daeea38f7f611fed1/0_0_8256_5504/1000.jpg\" alt=\"“Catastrophic damage at a time we can least afford it” … Peter Dutton speaks against the IR bill.\" width=\"1000\" height=\"667\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">“Catastrophic damage at a time we can least afford it” … Peter Dutton speaks against the IR bill.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Lukas Coch/AAP</span> </figcaption> </figure>  <p>Dutton said:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>We strongly support choice.

Many businesses will have to contend with the union machine, and their mob-like extortion and intimidation for the first time.</p> </blockquote> <p>Dutton said the bill will do “catastrophic damage at a time we can least afford it”.

And as a result of that consultation, extensively, there are a range of amendments that were removed by the government.</p> <p>We do want to make sure that we get this right. But we also want to make sure that wages get moving because we understand the pressure that family budgets are under.</p> <p>And we understand that you cannot have a circumstance whereby particularly feminised industries – our cleaners, our childcare workers, our aged care workers, our disability care workers, heroes of the pandemic – you deserve something more than a thanks.</p> <p>They deserve an increase in their wages. And that’s why what our industrial relations legislation is aimed at doing, is working effectively, constructively with the business community, consulting with COSBOA, ACCI and anyone else who wants to join us in discussing that legislation so I thank the member and other members who contribute constructively to it, you certainly will get it right and get it done.</p> </blockquote> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T04:07:10.759Z\">at 4.07am GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-6369cbfa8f0857d62bd0238d\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-08T03:27:00.226Z\">3.27am <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p><strong>Mark Dreyfus </strong>takes a dixer to talk about the bullying claims at the AAT which were raised during estimates:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Over recent weeks, those opposite including the opposition leader have complained that the AAT is, his words, stacked with political appointees who cannot be trusted to approve warrants for the proposed new national anti-corruption commission.</p> <p>Those opposite appear to have no sense of irony at all.</p> <p>According to the opposition leader, the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal lack the independence and requisite level of oversight and intellect to perform the important role of approving warrants, even though, as minister for home affairs, the same leader of the opposition radically expanded the role of AAT members in issuing warrants.</p> <p>For the benefit of the opposition leader, yes, the AAT is stacked with political appointees and that’s because he and his colleagues spent almost a decade stacking the AAT with political appointees.

And so all the work that we had previously done in relation to getting people prepared to participate in Attack applies here. </p> <p>… there are all the issues that I described in relation to nuclear stewardship which we need to be thinking through … it’s kind of, I almost feel, above my paygrade, but it is just the concept that everything is more far more robust. And so we need to be thinking about that.</p> <p><strong>And the final point I’ll make is, a lot of focus has been put on South Australia, that’s appropriate, that is where we will develop the capability to build submarines. WA is going to matter as well, it’s really going to matter.</strong> WA is obviously the home to our submarine fleet now [and] will continue to be that going forward and has I think, a very particular role play in the next few years.

The program was rated G and has been heavily promoted on TV and on the app. Why is the ABC grooming children with this sort of adult content?</p> <p><strong>Anderson:</strong> Senator, I don’t see that as grooming children with our content.

You were in government at the time. Can you clarify how that works?</p> <p><strong>Karen Andrews:</strong></p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>Yes, I can. So Fortem were engaged in a competitive tender process for the Black Summer fires. And as you heard John Bale say they were one of the final successful tenders. When we needed to look at an opportunity to build capability, we looked at how we could build scale here. </p> <p>Now, it’s the same thing that’s done with manufacturing. You start off with a level of funding and support and you build the scale. We need to build scale and support for our first responders. And that’s exactly what we did. So when we knew that we needed to build more capability, that we needed to make sure that our first responders were being appropriately looked after and cared for after the trauma that they themselves had experienced, we then looked at what we could do to scale it up. And Fortem already had the runs on the board. So this should not be a case of just dealing out small amounts of money to organisations. </p> <p>In Australia, we know that we have to build scale - or the Coalition understands the need to build scale - so there has been a process that has been successful in the past. So this is additional funding that builds on that process. </p> <p>Just to clarify there, it was by competitive tender at the time. My understanding of what happened with the Black Summer fires is that there was a process that was undertaken. It was managed, I believe, through a different department to Home Affairs or PMC but there was a competitive process. John Bale mentioned that when he spoke earlier this morning but I’m more than I’m sure that he is able to provide additional detail exactly of the process that he undertook. But he mentioned four organisations of which two of those were successful as a result of that process that was undertaken.</p> </blockquote> <p>Q: Why would the prime minister’s office then say there wasn’t?</p> <p>Andrews:</p> <blockquote class=\"quoted\"> <p>I have no idea.

Welcome to the Australia politics blog. Amy Remeikis will be along soon to take you through the day but before then here’s a quick roundup of the stories making news this morning.</p> <p>The secret report by the former Coalition government into the sports rorts scandal has criticised the decision-making process <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/07/complete-phil-gaetjens-report-into-sports-rorts-scandal-released-under-foi-laws\">by former sports minister Bridget McKenzie</a> and its “lack of transparency”. The findings by former top public servant Phil Gaetjens were kept secret for two years but have been revealed by a freedom of information request.</p> <p>Sewage leaks into flood waters are being blamed for “massive fish kills” along parts of the Murray River system in northern Victoria. Authorities have <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2022/nov/08/smells-like-sewage-blackwater-from-victorian-floods-causes-mass-fish-deaths\">warned residents to stay clear of the water</a> which some believe has been contaminated with human waste in the wake of the catastrophic flooding events of the past few weeks.</p> <p>The aftermath of natural disasters are also a key focus at the Cop27 climate summit that began in Egypt overnight. As around 100 world leaders gathered in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, they were told by the UN chief, Antonio Guterres, that the globe was on a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/nov/07/cop27-climate-summit-un-secretary-general-antonio-guterres\">“highway to climate hell”</a>. But the devil will be in the detail at the two-week talks, with the thorniest issue being “loss and damage” funding for developing countries hit by climate-related disasters. Chris Bowen will be representing the federal government.

Here are some of the highlights: The cybercriminals allegedly behind the Medibank data breach have threatened to start releasing some of the data since Medibank has refused to pay the ransom. The threats came as a survey from the Australian National University suggests more than six million Australians have fallen victim to a data breach in the last year. The Australian federal police commissioner said women and children recently repatriated from Syria will continue to be assessed by the AFP and counter-terrorism teams. It was revealed in Senate estimates that the Morrison government’s cancellation of the French submarine contract cost $591m. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the Labor caucus that he is “committed” to reforming the administrative appeals tribunal. A senior staff member of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is alleged to have urinated on staff members at a function in Armidale in late 2021, and has now resigned. The Labor senator Glenn Sterle referred to Bridget McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” during a Senate estimates fracas this morning, and later apologised. The royal commission into robodebt heard that a Department of Human Services official nominated a public servant for a 2017 Australia Day award to mark his role designing the botched scheme. The inquiry into alleged war crimes conducted by Australian special forces has expanded beyond the Brereton report, investigators confirmed. And the former Greens leader Bob Brown was arrested in north-eastern Tasmania while protesting against logging in forests that environmentalists say are breeding habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot. Look after yourselves folks, and we’ll see you again tomorrow. Mark Dreyfus says AAT has a ‘completely unacceptable’ bullying record The administrative appeals tribunal has a “completely unacceptable” record of bullying complaints on top of the Coalition’s “miserable record” of stacking the body, the attorney general has said. As we reported earlier, Mark Dreyfus made the comments in question time on Tuesday, seizing on the latest controversy involving the tribunal to bolster Labor’s case to reform or replace it due to partisan appointments made by the Coalition. In opposition, Dreyfus frequently criticised the Coalition’s practice of appointing former staffers and politicians from its ranks to the powerful tribunal, which reviews the merits of government decisions in areas including welfare, immigration and the national disability insurance scheme. The government is actively considering abolishing the AAT and replacing it with a new merits review tribunal. Dreyfus did not rule out that option in June when it was proposed by a Labor-chaired Senate committee. A decision on the AAT’s future is expected as early as December. Read the full story here: I have no context for this but it seems apt for  all this. Emus appear to be causing problems … in the United States. Because people are buying them to keep as pets. Because of TikTok. This is where the entirety of Australia shakes its head in bewilderment. Peter Dutton speaks against Labor’s industrial relations bill The opposition leader, Peter Dutton, has spoken in the lower house against the industrial relations bill. He noted the millions of dollars unions have donated to Labor in recent years, arguing in this bill “the government repays them in spades”. Dutton accused Labor of “sacrificing small businesses at the altar of unionism” through a reform that will “usher in economy-wide strikes”. He said the “desire to push the bill through at warp speed” shows disrespect to workers and businesses. Dutton said it was “absolutely unprecedented” for the Fair Work Commission to be given powers to arbitrate intractable disputes, a move that would “kill off bargaining” and move back towards centralised wage fixing. Dutton claimed there is “no shortage of strike action right now” – which ignores that strikes are at their lowest level in decades – citing the RTBU train strike in Sydney as a sign of things to come. That is exactly the sort of dispute that the FWC is likely to be able to arbitrate, getting trains running again. Dutton said: We strongly support choice. If people choose to join a union we honour and respect their choice to do so ... Multi-employer bargaining is a mechanism for unionists to assert their relevance in the 21st century ... Many businesses will have to contend with the union machine, and their mob-like extortion and intimidation for the first time. Dutton said the bill will do “catastrophic damage at a time we can least afford it”. He called on independents in the house and Senate to stand for integrity (and block or significantly amend the bill). Dutton is proposing his own amendments removing the elements of multi-employer bargaining out of the bill, and reinstating the Australian Building and Construction Commission. Want to catch up on the day’s events? If you’re not already signed up to our Afternoon Update, I highly recommend you do. You’ll get this nice little curated snippet of everything that’s happened in the past 12 hours sent straight to your inbox, from Antoun Issa. Here’s today’s edition: We had a post from Luke Henriques-Gomes in the blog a little earlier this afternoon – he’s been watching the royal commission into robodebt this week. Here’s his wrap of today’s proceedings so far. The leader of the house, Tony Burke, has successfully moved a motion accelerating and curtailing the House of Representatives debate on Labor’s secure jobs better pay bill. Under the motion, Peter Dutton will have 30 minutes to speak on the bill, then speeches will be cut to 10 minutes as the bill is debated through Tuesday and Wednesday, before a further cut to 5 minutes if the debate is still going on Wednesday evening. Amendments will be voted on in batches, to give it a vote on Thursday. Several independents spoke against the motion. North Sydney MP Kylea Tink said: Just eight business days after the introduction of the most significant IR reform since WorkChoices in 2006, we’re being asked to truncate due process. I welcome discussion [on the bill] but I’m concerned due process is being severely truncated. MP Zali Steggall expressed “disappointment with the government”, after three years of complaints about debate being curtailed it has now used a procedure which “attempts to move past gagging debate altogether” but still curtails debate. The Liberals moved an amendment to neuter the motion. The government won the votes 72 to 67, outvoting the crossbench and opposition. Greens senator Nick McKim is also asking about the stage-three tax cuts, whether abolishing them would reduce inflation more quickly. Treasury deputy secretary Luke Yeaman has said that the inflationary impact of the stage-three tax cuts had already been factored into the budget, and that considering the inflationary impact of the measure was “not the only factor”: If you take more income, and it can be tax cuts or spending on any front ... out of the economy then that is likely to lead to a reduction in economic activity and therefore inflation. I would say though and it is an important point ... that the prevailing economic circumstances matter, as do the effects more broadly of tax changes or any other policy measure frankly on a whole range of other factors such as distribution and participation. That is one factor that you would consider in such a decision, but it is not the only factor. Yeaman rejected the suggestion from McKim that leaving the tax cuts in the budget would be inflationary: I wouldn’t use that term, Senator. However, Yeaman conceded that not proceeding with stage-three tax cuts would effectively be an increase in taxes, which would put downward pressure on inflation. Tasmania police have confirmed they have charged environmental campaigner Bob Brown with trespass following a protest against logging of native forest in the state’s northeast. The 77-year-old ex-Greens leader was one of three environmentalists charged after a protest in what police called a “timber production zone” at Lake Leake. Campaigners say the forest is nesting habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot, a migratory species that scientists say could be extinct in a decade, and which is supposed to be protected under law. A police spokesperson said they were called to the area after reports a group of people were obstructing logging contractors. They said some in the group left without incident, but a man - Brown - initially failed to move on and would be “summonsed to attend court on a trespass matter”. They said: Two women who had secured themselves to logging equipment with metal lock-on devices were arrested and charged with trespass and obstruct police after search and rescue officers had to attend and release them from the equipment. One we missed from earlier today in Estimates: David Pocock asked the Australian Electoral Commission about “doctored superman corflutes from the election campaign” – which depicted him wearing an Australian Greens shirt. The AEC has previously said it considered this to breach section 329 of the Electoral Act, which bans material that “is likely to mislead or deceive an elector in relation to the casting of a vote”. AEC officials told Pocock that it can’t prosecute people, but it had referred the matter to the AFP to investigate further. Rain relief on the way – perhaps? – as oceans shift to more neutral conditions Eastern Australia has been enjoying a relatively dry spell of late – unless you’re in the path of some slow-moving major flood waters, such as the Barwon-Darling/Bakka river. The Bureau of Meteorology has updated its climate drivers report, with some good news from the north-west. The negative phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole has ended, snapping the first recorded back-to-back annual occurrence of this event. During the negative phase, surface waters off north-western Australia are relatively warm (compared with those on the western side of the Indian Ocean), making it more likely for clouds to form. These rainbands stream across the continent in late winter and spring, lifting rainfall as we have seen, particularly in the southeast. The shallow La Niña in the Pacific is also tilting back towards neutral conditions. After three La Niña years in a row, we’ll be glad to see the back of this one, which is likely in January, if not before. Weather and climate, though, don’t switch on or off, and so we’re probably talking about the gradual easing of conditions as summer plays out. As an island continent, though, what happens to the south plays a role too. The Southern Annular Mode – which tends to produce more rain across the nether parts of the country – looks like remaining in its positive phase for now at least. As the bureau notes, that means increased odds of above-average rainfall for the near term for parts of eastern NSW, eastern Victoria, and south-eastern Queensland. (Western Tasmania seems to be the place to head if you want drier-than-usual weather just now.) The wildcard in the pack, though, could be tropical cyclones, which can bring a lot of extra rain to many areas. La Niñas favour more such tempests than usual, which is something we didn’t see in the first two years of this trio. Will we be lucky for a third year in a row? Department of Human Services officials nominated a public servant for a 2017 Australia Day award to mark his role designing the robodebt scheme, a royal commission has heard. Emails presented to the royal commission on Tuesday from November 2016 show that an email from DHS official Scott Britton nominated another official, Jason Ryman, for an Australia Day achievement award for 2017. He was nominated by the department’s compliance branch for “leading the Online Compliance Intervention” project – which was the robodebt scheme. Britton, who was giving evidence on Tuesday, said he did not know if Ryman had received the award. Other emails aired in the commission in early 2017 showed that then human services minister Alan Tudge had written to his department asking for a briefing, including “real life examples” of the use of ATO data to raise debts, in part because the then prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, had read an opinion piece about the scheme. Tudge also requested details of the savings the scheme would generate. The inquiry also heard that throughout the second half of 2016 – after the robodebt scheme had been ramped up – Tudge’s office asked Department of Human Services officials when the scheme would hit a $500m savings target. Departmental emails showed public servants were not aware of any official target, and Britton told the inquiry he expected that the “target” was a milestone that Tudge’s office wanted to mark with a media release. The commission continues. And on that note, I am going to hand you over to Steph Convery for the rest of the afternoon. We have two more days of the house sitting and three more days of estimates, so who knows what could happen! Thank you to everyone who followed along with me today – I will be back early tomorrow morning. Have fun with Steph – in the meantime, take care of you. And in case you haven’t seen it from Josh Taylor: The online safety regulator has written to Elon Musk, cautioning him his company must comply with Australian law and expressing concern about the cuts to the platform’s safety team and proposed changes to verification. Julie Inman Grant, who worked for Twitter prior to becoming Australia’s eSafety commissioner in 2016, told a Senate estimates hearing on Tuesday she had written to Twitter’s new billionaire owner to seek assurances Twitter would comply with takedown and other government requests. Australia’s online safety act gives the eSafety commissioner powers to issue requests to companies like Twitter to provide information to her about accounts or remove content such as bullying or image-based abuse targeted at Australians. The Coalition’s shadow finance minister Jane Hume is asking about the costing of the stage-three tax cuts, suggesting the new government had costed the measure because it had considered scrapping it. Hume asks why Treasury would cost an “already legislated government policy”. “There is a costing that has been done to remove the stage-three tax cuts,” Hume said. Last month, the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, announced that the cost of the stage-three tax cuts had blown out by $11bn over the medium term to $254bn. The finance minister Katy Gallagher said it was a routine budgeting process, and accused the Coalition of leaving the budget in “a mess”. “We wanted a very clear understanding of everything that was and wasn’t in the budget,” Gallagher said. Yeaman said “not surprisingly” Treasury had looked at a range of different options on both the spending and revenue side, “to help inform government decision making”. Hume requested Treasury provide an answer as to when the costing was requested, commenced and completed. Wet girl summer seems inevitable. Greens senator David Shoebridge said estimates has revealed cancelling the French submarine contract cost “half a billion dollars”: Only in a bungled multibillion-dollar Defence project would a government even try to hide a lazy $591m in additional costs. These costs have been ferreted away off the Defence budget, but they will still have to be paid for by the public. It’s the opportunity cost of these funds that really hurts. When we pay an extra $591m for not building submarines we lose those funds for public housing, schools or income relief. While there are strategic arguments for retaining skilled staff, the fact that the ASC contract costs $1.3m for every job is astounding. The ASC contract is filling a staff capacity gap caused by the bungled handling of the future submarine project. This proves that there are far more effective ways to promote employment and economic opportunities across Australia than throwing countless millions at overpriced defence contracts. Nationals senator Matt Canavan has been pushing Treasury on the components of inflation and its previous forecasts, saying that inflation had started rising ahead of the Ukraine invasion. Canavan suggested it was “self-interested” for Treasury to blame the pandemic and the war. Yeaman is outlining how the pandemic and its supply shocks had contributed to initial inflation rises, pointing to shutdowns in China as an example and the shortages of goods. Canavan is also asking Yeaman to explain what Treasury had meant when it talked about possible government intervention in the energy market, asking if price caps were on the table. Sam Reinhardt, deputy secretary of the fiscal group, said that they were looking at a range of options. It’s a significant issue for government, so as you would understand, Senator, there are options along the whole supply chain for electricity generation and we will look at all the options that are available.” Canavan asks if that included looking at any increase in supply, saying Australia should be looking at increasing its exports of gas and coal to help assist other nations, including allies. Reinhardt said that increases in supply that fed into electricity markets would reduce prices, and pointed to a “really substantial number of reforms” in the budget that would increase grid capacity and have a longer term impact on prices. Yeaman said that while Treasury would provide advice, the decision on what type of intervention took place would ultimately come down to the government. Given the market is currently being hit by ... these disruptions, things that act quickly and directly on the price are going to be most effective in our view .... in helping people to deal with the current energy price shock and effect this redistribution of income.” Finance minister Katy Gallagher said the government’s focus was on what could be done in the short term. Economy shows no signs of wage-price spiral, Treasury deputy says Greens senator Nick McKim is asking about the contribution of wages and corporate profits to inflation, with Treasury deputy secretary Luke Yeaman saying there was no evidence of a wage-price spiral emerging in the economy. He said inflation was being driven by external supply shocks and cost pressures coming from the pandemic. McKim pushes Yeaman on whether corporate profiteering was a driver of inflation, saying this was the view of “well-credentialed economists” in Australia and overseas. “Obviously, corporate profitability has been high recently, which is primarily driven from our perspective by the very large increases in commodity prices that we’ve seen recently, and I think fundamentally, the things that are driving inflation are as I said, those cost pressures coming through out of the pandemic and those external supply shocks from outside not corporate profits per se,” Yeaman said. McKim said companies were using the external price shocks as “cover” to jack up their prices, and people who were doing it toughest were getting “smashed”. Yeaman said that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission was looking at any potential price gouging. McKim then asks Yeaman about correspondence within the department that said high prices may be coming from “margin rebuild”. McKim and Yeaman are now discussing whether this equates to corporate profiteering, with Yeaman saying that this could mean a return to normal dividends following the pandemic, with McKim saying that rebuilding margins clearly meant making profits. Brewers hope for excise freeze amid warmer weather The beleaguered beer industry has weathered pandemic shutdowns, supply chain issues and the August tax hike, and is hoping for a bumper summer. Coopers Brewery has posted its 2022 results, and managing director Tim Cooper said a 3.5% fall in volume sales was a decent result, “given the supply and demand pressures facing the entire industry”, although he warned the cost-of-living crisis and price increases were affecting people’s purchasing decisions. For Coopers, profit before tax was $27.3m, down from $36.5m the year before. “While the overall market remains tight, we are seeing some positive signs emerging,” Cooper said. The Brewers’ Association of Australia has warned that the next excise increase, in February 2023, could push prices higher still. Chief executive officer, John Preston, said the August increase of 4% was the “highest in 30 years”, and that the February increase would be as high again. Beer is already $15 for a “higher end” pint in some places, he said, and that would become a more common price. Bars then have a choice of absorbing the cost or passing it on, Preston said. The association is calling for an excise freeze, and hoping the warmer weather and post-lockdown crowds deliver for the bars. “We’re just hoping that they get a really good run at it this summer,” Preston said. Mark Dreyfus finishes up the questions with a dixer on the sports rorts Gaetjens report and question time, and my patience for it, ends. Andrew Hastie has a question for Richard Marles: My question is for the minister for defence. The prime minister said he does not want duplication in the national anti-corruption commission. Why is the ADF included in the commission but senior unit leaders are not. Marles: Thank you, Mr Speaker and I thank the member for his question. The military tribunal have their important role to play. The government has committed to producing an anti-corruption commission which is going to be robust in accordance with the commitments that we took to the last election. Adam Bandt has another of the crossbench questions: Greedy energy corporations are driving up bills by 56% while making record profits. prime minister, would you back the Greens plan to freeze electricity bills funded by a windfall tax on gas and energy corporations to deliver immediate relief? Anthony Albanese: What we will be doing – I thank the member for Melbourne for his question. And I thank him for the constructive engagement as well. I understand that we have different solutions that we will present in dealing with the challenge of climate change but I don’t doubt his sincerity in wanting to deal with it. That is the starting point. It is acknowledging the science which is there. We went to the election with a very clear plan. Our powering Australia plan – it acknowledges the changes that are required in our economy that will provide for an 82% share of our energy mix to be renewables by 2030. We understand that that is the cheapest and cleanest form of new energy. I know that, on a number of areas, housing, energy – in these areas – we have had propositions stating we could just take the action of freezing payments as is put forward by the member for Melbourne. It is completely unclear to me and upon any legal advice of how you would do that, in terms of intervening in the way in which the member for Melbourne’s suggested. What the government has to do is to come up with practical plans that make a practical difference. We did that in June by making sure that the lights stayed on. We did that in negotiations that took place with gas suppliers to make sure that we secured the greater than the 56 petajoules that was anticipated would be the shortfall by the ACCC. We will do that as we are working through the current solutions or working through with industry, working through with our departments, working through with manufacturers as well. Because we understand that the increase that is occurring as a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine in global energy prices that is feeding into global inflation as well, it is a challenge for the economy. We will deal with it with real solutions rather than slogans. That is a Labor way and the responsibility we have as a government. The Liberal MP for O’Connor, Rick Wilson has a question for the prime minister: Can the prime minister please explain why NDIS workers and soldiers will be subject to the national anti-corruption commission but union officials exercising their power under the law of the commonwealth will have a specific exclusion? Anthony Albanese: I thank the member for his question. He seems unaware that of course people in the industrial relations system are covered by the Fair Work Ombudsman, as well as the Fair Work Commission. They are subject to that. One of the things that we have done with the national anti-corruption commission – the party may want to talk to the leader of the opposition about this, because he has made it very clear that what we should not do with the national anti-corruption commission is duplicate systems that are in place already. So if you look at for example parliamentarians with IPEA for example are excluded from the provisions. I’ve done that. They’ve done that as a result of the clear indication from those opposite that I agree with, that I agree with as well. That what you need to do with the national anti-corruption commission is fill the gaps which are there. You don’t need to duplicate laws and provisions which are available already. The independent MP for Fowler, Dai Le has another of the crossbench questions: Will the treasurer tell the House how can the government offer additional childcare relief for those earning up to $530,000 while removing the low and middle income tax offsets for individuals and families earning less than $130,000 who need tax relief the most during a cost-of-living crisis? How will the government provide immediate relief for those families struggling, like those in Fowler? Jim Chalmers: Once again, I appreciate the question from the Member for Fowler and thank her for the conversations we’ve had about cost of living in the past. We recognise and understand that when inflation is high and rising for longer than we would like, Australian families and Australians more broadly are under more pressure than we would like and when it comes to low and middle income tax, it was a decision made by our predecessors to end the LMITO [lower and middle income earner tax offsets] and that has ended, that’s a decision that my predecessors [including] treasurer Frydenberg made very clear. What we have tried to do in the budget and what we have done in the budget is to provide cost-of-living relief your constituents and to all of our constituents in a way that does not add to inflation in our economy. We recognise that the reason why real wages are going backwards is because inflation has been too high for too long. We recognise that interest rates are going up because inflation is higher than we want it to be and that is largely a consequence of pressure coming from around the world but it’s felt around the kitchen tables of our communities and so the cost-of-living relief that we are providing in the budget, whether it be cheaper early childhood education, expansion of paid parental leave, whether it be the housing accord to get more, cheaper rental properties into the market, whether it be cheaper medicines, our policies to get wages moving again, all of these things are all about providing the cost-of-living relief that people need and deserve in a way that is not counter-productive by making the inflation problem even worse. So that’s the government’s strategy here. The alternative would be to risk making the inflation problem worse. There is something like $7.5bn of cost-of-living relief flowing in the budget. Obviously, as we go through these challenging times, if there is more that we can responsibly do, obviously we will consider it and will always try to do the right thing by her constituents and all the people be represent in this place. The Liberal MP for Lindsey, Melissa McIntosh has a question for Anthony Albanese that Chris Bowen takes. In Lindsey, the owners of a local cafe, Screaming Beans are struggling with the pressure of rising inflation and power prices. Given the budget indicates that power prices will increase by 56%, why are businesses like Screaming Beans having to pay for the Prime Minister’s broken promise to cut power prices? (Screaming Beans is now in the Hansard. And also, describes my coffee habit.) Bowen: I thank the member for her question and this government is extremely concerned about power prices for businesses, small, medium and large, and power prices for industry and for residents as well. And this government has taken the approach of being straight with the Australian people about the pressures on energy prices, the pressures caused by very high coal and gas import costs. That’s why we took the approach in the budget and the Treasurer took the approach in the budget of being straight with the Australian people. It was an alternative approach, which is not to be straight with the Australian people. We took option A to be straight forward with the Australian people. The previous government took option B, of hiding those price rises. They are in every sense the B team, option B was the one embraced by ... Paul Fletcher has a point of order: Previously on the 1 August you directed a minister to be relevant to the question where a minister had strayed and began talking about the record of the former government. They cannot help themselves, he has done it again, and should be directed back to the question. Milton Dick: The minister has said some context and one minute and I will ask him to return to the specific broken promises alleged in the question. About, and also the rise in power prices which was also in the question which he is referring to and I call the minister. Bowen: In relation to the rising power prices, if the option they took and there has been a development in recent days on this important topic which will be of interest to the house because previously the Member for Hume denied hiding the power price rises and said it did not happen and then he said he did not know about the power price rises when he changed the law and last week of the National Press Club, he said I was acting on departmental advice, Mr Speaker. How pathetic, to blame your public servants for your decision, Mr Speaker. That’s how pathetic these guys are, blaming a department. That is what they are lowered to. That’s why the prime minister, treasurer, resources minister and myself have made it clear we will not be standing by and watching the prices of coal and gas flow through to Australian industries and households, that’s what you did and you did not have the guts to tell the Australian people you could not help them. You hid that from the people and that’s how pathetic you got and how that’s how pathetic you still are. Angus Taylor asks about gas prices, giving Chris Bowen an opportunity to use “well done Angus” (a reference to when Taylor or someone in his office forgot to move to the shadow account on Facebook and meant Taylor ended up congratulating himself for his own announcement). Bowen: I welcome a question from the opposition about gas because it was those opposite that promised a gas-led recovery. Remember that? What they left was a gas-led bin fire. Because on the day that our old friend the Member for Hume announced a gas-led recovery, the price of gas was $4.28 a gigajoule. The gas-led recovery went so well that by the time of the election the price of gas was $34.75 a gigajoule. Well done, Angus! Treasury’s deputy secretary Luke Yeaman is fronting the Senate economics legislation committee for budget estimates. After outlining global and domestic pressures facing the Australian economy, Yeaman – who read an opening statement from Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy who is absent – said that the government will need to address “profound” budget pressures in the future. Beyond the near term, the budget pressures are more profound and will likely require a combination of spending restraint and increases in taxes to reduce deficits and lower debt. We are fortunate in Australia to begin this journey with a relatively lower level of debt as a proportion of GDP than in many countries. Nevertheless, necessary policy decisions will be difficult in order to best promote the national interest.” On energy, Yeaman said Treasury was supportive of government intervention to address surging energy prices in a way that it wouldn’t normally be, saying in usual circumstances high price signals were important to allow for “helpful adjustment” in the market. The circumstances of war-driven price shocks are different and outside the frame of such an approach. In our view such shocks bring into scope government intervention. For example, the current gas and thermal coal price increases are leading to unusually high prices and profits for some companies, prices and profits that are well beyond the usual bounds of investment and profit cycles. The same price increases are leading to a reduction in the real incomes of many people, with the most severely affected being lower income working households. The energy price increases are also significantly reducing the profits of many businesses and raising questions about their viability. Yeaman said that interventions that “directly address the higher domestic thermal coal and gas prices” would be “optimal” and Australia was “uniquely placed” to pursue this type of intervention given it is an energy exporter. He suggested any government intervention should take into account the different level of shock being experienced by different state and territories and that it should also be temporary and “regularly reviewed”. Angus Taylor to Jim Chalmers: Before the election, the prime minister promised Australians cheaper mortgages. Can the prime minister inform Australians how much the cash rate has increased since May 21? The Labor side of the house makes a lot of noise at this, because – audacity. Anthony Albanese: I will ask the treasurer to answer the question but we are not going to take lectures from the lightweight on the hill over there. The Coalition side of the house makes a lot of noise at this, because – theatre. Paul Fletcher wants Albanese to withdraw his “unparliamentary language”. Milton Dick says there was too much noise for him to hear. Jim Chalmers: With questions that bad is it any wonder he hardly ever gets one. It might not have dawned on the shadow treasurer, nor on the dregs of the former government which are arrayed before us … The Coalition again gets up in arms. Dick makes a general warning about language. It seems he heard that one. Chalmers: Would leftovers be parliamentary, Mr Speaker? The government side laughs, Dick tells Chalmers to stop the jokes and get on with the answer. Chalmers: Thank you to the shadow treasurer for a very rare and particularly bad question. Because as everybody else in this House knows, interest rates started going up on their watch. Interest rates started going up for a range of reasons from the extraordinary lows that they were at - 0.1% - and they are currently out to 2.85% as every member of this house knows. Except perhaps the shadow treasurer. Now, if the shadow treasurer had any credibility whatsoever, he would acknowledge first of all that rates started going up on the former government’s watch. And secondly, he would say what members over there said when they started going up during the election, which was interest rates were not going to be at 0.1% for ever. So what we have done and what we have done, Mr Speaker, and one of the reasons why we are proud of the budget we handed down two weeks ago and the shadow treasurer won’t ask me any questions about that budget, but what we did that budget was make sure we were making the inflation problem was. The fact is, we showed remarkable spending restraint and we invested in the supply chain issues which were pushing up ... in the economy. I was asked about interest rate. Taylor starts yelling things and Paul Fletcher jumps up with a point on relevance: That was your promise what are you doing about it? Dick says Chalmers is in order. The treasurer is referring to interest rates which in my understanding is linked to mortgages. So I call the treasurer. Chalmers: You are already far ahead of the shadow treasurer, Mr Speaker, if you make that link and far ahead of the manager of opposition business. Because the point I am making is that the budget we handed down two weeks ago was aimed fairly and squarely at this inflation challenge in our economy, which was a problem before the election, interest rates were going up before the election. They have absolutely no credibility if they won’t acknowledge that. Paul Fletcher is really falling back on his time debating at university. There is plenty of dour flourish in his interjections. Kate Chaney has one of the crossbench questions today: Australia has a history of complex industrial relations regulation and the multi-employer bargaining part of the secure jobs better pay bill is making many employers very nervous. Wages will not increase if businesses and their employees have to navigate an even more complex wage-setting system full of unintended consequences. What does the government think is more important, getting the bill passed urgently or getting it right? Anthony Albanese: I thank the Member for Curtin for her question and for engaging constructively with the government. We had a meeting earlier today in which these issues were canvassed and raised and I’m always happy to meet with members of the crossbench, as I am with anyone in this parliament who has serious policy issues to raise. The fact is that the government that I lead was elected with the mandate to increase people’s wages. We went to an election and cannot have been clearer. We also can’t have been clearer either in the speech I gave to the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Sydney during the election campaign. I spoke about the need to get bargaining operating effectively. I spoke about the fact that productivity was flatlining over a considerable period of time and that is the Reserve Bank governor had indicated, that we had a circumstance whereby wages just simply were not keeping up, and that was actually holding back the economy, that’s a constraint on the economy. What we have been doing with the industrial relations legislation is making sure that we consulted not just during that period, not just after we came to office but at the jobs and skill summit, in the lead-up to the legislation being moved by the minister for workplace relations and then, during the inquiry that is taking place into the legislation and also prior to the legislation being debated in this chamber. And as a result of that consultation, extensively, there are a range of amendments that were removed by the government. We do want to make sure that we get this right. But we also want to make sure that wages get moving because we understand the pressure that family budgets are under. And we understand that you cannot have a circumstance whereby particularly feminised industries – our cleaners, our childcare workers, our aged care workers, our disability care workers, heroes of the pandemic – you deserve something more than a thanks. They deserve an increase in their wages. And that’s why what our industrial relations legislation is aimed at doing, is working effectively, constructively with the business community, consulting with COSBOA, ACCI and anyone else who wants to join us in discussing that legislation so I thank the member and other members who contribute constructively to it, you certainly will get it right and get it done. Mark Dreyfus takes a dixer to talk about the bullying claims at the AAT which were raised during estimates: Over recent weeks, those opposite including the opposition leader have complained that the AAT is, his words, stacked with political appointees who cannot be trusted to approve warrants for the proposed new national anti-corruption commission. Those opposite appear to have no sense of irony at all. According to the opposition leader, the members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal lack the independence and requisite level of oversight and intellect to perform the important role of approving warrants, even though, as minister for home affairs, the same leader of the opposition radically expanded the role of AAT members in issuing warrants. For the benefit of the opposition leader, yes, the AAT is stacked with political appointees and that’s because he and his colleagues spent almost a decade stacking the AAT with political appointees. They are attacking their own miserable record. The opposition leader and its colleagues are now openly admitting what many of us have been saying for years. … Each year, tens of thousands of Australians rely on the AAT to independently review decisions made by commonwealth departments and ministers that have major and sometimes life altering impacts on their lives. Those opposite do not care about those Australians. Those opposite have never cared about those Australians and they never will and just yesterday we heard more troubling revelations about the internal culture of the AAT, after almost 10 years of Liberal party stacking. Seventeen current members of the tribunal have faced bullying, discrimination or harassment complaints since 1 July 2016. One of those members has had at least five such complaints made of them. That’s completely unacceptable and it’s another problem that our government will have to address. The Liberal party of Australia deserves to be tarnished forever for the legacy of this uniquely disgraceful exhibition of political cronyism which has come at enormous cost to taxpayers to the AAT and to Australia’s system of administrative law more generally. Angie Bell, the Liberal MP for Moncrieff, asks how much wholesale power prices will need to fall for the government to meet its “lower power bills by $275 by 2025” promise. Anthony Albanese gives his same answer he gives to all these questions – moves to renewables, which are the cheapest form of power, the war in Ukraine making things worse, and working towards solutions. The opposition interjects for relevance, as they usually do, it is ignored, as it usually is, and we move on. The first dixer (question written by government tactics team to a member of the government) is also on climate. Anthony Albanese talks about what the government is doing: [Cop27] sits in a context where it comes after the hottest decade on record. And indeed, the past eight years are on track to be the eight warmest on record. Think about that. Every one of the eight hottest years on record is the last eight years! The last eight years. And what we’ve seen, of course, not just the impact of this with the devastating floods in places like Pakistan, we don’t actually have to look offshore. We can look here at the increased number of extreme weather events and the increase in the severity of them. Just before question time, I was speaking to the member for Riverina about Forbes in his electorate that we visited just a couple of weeks ago. We visited as the flood waters were going down. Now, they’ve gone up again and fortunately, for the people of Forbes who have done it so tough, they’ve gone down again. I visited just a week ago, Lismore with the New South Wales premier, where we’re actually having to buy homes to move them out of the flood plain because people do not feel safe in those communities. We’ve had the devastating bushfires, including in areas of rainforest that had never burnt ever before – ever before! And we have the secretary of the UN say last night, “The science is clear, any hope of limiting temperature rise to 1.5 degrees means achieving global net zero emissions by 2050.” But that 1.5 degree goal is on life support and the machines are rattling. This parliament, the major parties apparently are all agreed on zero by 2050. They are all agreed except for the rhetoric, and you wanted to know it if you follow the statements that are aimed. So our government is acting and one of our first acts was to sign up to our changed nationally determined contribution of 43% by 2030. We enshrined in law net zero by 2050 and we are investing in renewable energy. Climate change is a challenge for our generation but it’s also a challenge [for the world]. Peter Dutton to Anthony Albanese: The Coalition has ruled out paying compensation to other nations for the effects of climate change. Will the Albanese government also rule out signing Australia up to compensate other countries as part of the deal at COP27 in Egypt. If you missed it, please read Murph’s column from the weekend: With that in mind, here is Albanese’s answer: One of things that I won’t do is in front of boom mic, make a joke about our island neighbours. That’s one of the things that I won’t do. I won’t do that. And I won’t do that because I want to build good relations with our Pacific neighbours. And one of the things that we provided for, we provided for in the budget for all there to see, and if the leader of the opposition wants to have a look at the budget papers, we’ve made it very clear that one of things that we will do is provide support for our Pacific Island neighbours for infrastructure that needs to be dealing with because of the threat that countries like Tuvalu and Kiribati are experiencing. One of the things that we saw during the election campaign, Mr Speaker, was the Solomon Islands was front and centre of the campaign. The fact that Australia, unfortunately, has stepped back at other nations with the strategic competition that’s occurring in our region. This is one of the things that we have to be strategic of with the national security issue. That is something that is recognised by the United States. It’s something that’s recognised by our other partners, and indeed, our allies. It’s something that was recognised in the Quad Leaders’ Meeting. The first thing that I did as prime minister was get on a plane and visit Tokyo to meet with Prime Minister Modi, Prime Minister Kushida and President Biden. And there, we spoke about the responsibility that we have as leaders of developed nations to engage in our region. In south-east Asia, in the Indo-Pacific. So what we won’t be doing, Mr Speaker, is trying to score a cheap domestic political point, and at the same time, actually set back our international relations. So you can’t say you care about strategic competition in the region, whilst you continue with this sort of position. No wonder, no wonder that Senator Wong has had to work so hard to restore Australia’s standing in our region. Bob Brown has been arrested in north-eastern Tasmania while protesting against logging in forests that environmentalists say are breeding habitat for the critically endangered swift parrot. Police led the former Greens leader out of the forest on Tuesday morning after he camped with other campaigners in what he called a “squalid” area of logged forest on Monday night. He is believed to have been charged on summons with trespass. Confirmation was being sought from Tasmania police. The swift parrot is a migratory species that spends winters on the mainland and summers nesting in Tasmanian forests depending on where its main food sources, blue and black gums, are flowering. A CSIRO-published guide last year estimated the population had slumped to about 750, down from 2,000 a decade ago. Peer-reviewed studies have suggested it could be extinct in 10 years, and forestry was the greatest threat to its survival. In a statement, Brown said he was under arrest for “upholding the laws of nature and the international biodiversity convention”. We have more than enough plantations to meet the nation’s wood needs. In this extinction crisis, the government will get majority public applause if it ends the unnecessary native forest carnage”. Ahead of question time is a condolence motion for former 1970s Liberal minister, Bob Ellicott. Resources minister Madeleine King was speaking about some of the issues with energy prices on the ABC not so long ago, which included this exchange: Q: You are saying retailers may be part of the problem here? That is where we are seeing increasing prices? King: I think the whole market as a problem, it is opaque, we can’t see into it. Minister Husic gets calls from manufacturers, I get calls from manufacturers, retailers, so you see, we’re all getting scatter-gun answers to these problems and what we really need is to find out the truth, and a transparent market will help us get to that and will put pressure on all providers, wholesalers, retailers, users of gas, gas powered generators to make sure everyone knows exactly what they are doing with the gas that people need. Q: So would you back Ed Husic’s comments when he calls these gas producers greedy, tone deaf, milking gas prices? Is that a fair observation to make? King: It is not the kind of language I would use. Sterle’s comments about McKenzie ‘completely unacceptable’, Watt says Agriculture minister Murray Watt said his Labor colleague Glenn Sterle’s comments about Bridget McKenzie were “completely unacceptable” and said he doesn’t want to hear such words repeated. Sterle, as we reported earlier, described Nationals senator McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” and told her to “be quiet” during a heated argument in a Senate estimates hearing. Sterle eventually apologised and withdrew the comment. Watt, the minister who was at the estimates desk during the argument, was asked about the comments in a brief press conference this afternoon. What Glenn said was completely unacceptable in the modern age. I’ve spoken with Glenn about it and I know he’s remorseful,” Watt said. He’s made his apology but it’s utterly unacceptable for those kinds of remarks to be made in any workplace environment or in society as a whole.” Watt called it “an extremely unfortunate remark that shouldn’t have been made”. I’m pleased Glenn pretty quickly made an apology and recognised that he’d done the wrong thing,” he said. I don’t want to see those kind of remarks made by any senator, no matter what their party is.” You know it is estimates week when there are warring press releases. Mark Dreyfus has just put this out: Contrary to claims made today by the discredited former Home Affairs Minister, overall funding for the Australian Federal Police increased in the Albanese Government’s first Budget. Budget Papers show that in 2022/23 total funding for the AFP is $1.84 billion. As was confirmed today in Senate Estimates, this is a $100 million increase on the AFP’s 2021/22 Budget, and higher than the funding committed in the Coalition’s final budget in March this year when Karen Andrews was the Minister responsible for the AFP. Nita Green: What is the total resourcing for the AFP in the 2022/23 financial year? Charlotte Tressler (AFP CFO): Thank you. The total resourcing for the AFP is $1.8428 billion, so almost $1.9 billion. Green: And how does that compare with the 2021/2022 financial year? Tressler: So, in terms of actual resources spent, as opposed to appropriation, it’s $100 million more than last financial year. This is an increase of more than 5% on the previous year, not a cut. In future, Karen Andrews should take more time reading Budget Papers before rushing out media releases making false claims. And then the apology: Question time is coming up – there is no sign of any random storms so we should get through it with power intact this time round today! The deputy Nationals leader, Perin Davey, has questioned the behaviour of the Labor senator Glenn Sterle, who referred to Bridget McKenzie as a “naughty little girl” during a Senate estimates fracas this morning. Sterle, a government senator for WA, said he was “going to do my block” during a disagreement in the rural and regional affairs committee in Parliament House this morning. McKenzie, the Nationals senator from Victoria, was asking questions of a dairy organisation appearing before the hearing, and pushed back on interjections from other senators about her line of questioning. McKenzie: It’s interesting – I’ve asked a legitimate question ... I would like to continue my questions... you’ve both been yabbering at me. “We’ve been going so well,” Sterle said, before McKenzie appeared to interject to defend herself. Sterle, the committee chair, then spoke up more loudly: Sterle: Senator McKenzie, do you always have to have the last word? I was going to defend you then. Honestly like a naughty little girl, can you be quiet while someone finishes? You don’t have to have the last word... I’m going to do my block in a minute. Sterle gave the call back to McKenzie, before further arguing with the Greens senator Peter Whish-Wilson about the tone of discussions. Whish-Wilson asked Sterle to withdraw his comment, but Sterle refused. You’re all as bad as each other... I will not withdraw it, I’m probably the easiest one to get on with. McKenzie herself asked Sterle to withdraw, whereupon he apologised and said “you’re not a naughty little girl”. We’ve contacted McKenzie’s office for comment, who declined to add any further to it. But Davey, the Nationals senator from NSW, tweeted in response to a clip of the exchange: Inquiry into alleged war crimes conducted by Australian special forces has expanded beyond Brereton report, investigators confirm Investigators from the Office of the Special Investigator have not yet been able to travel to Afghanistan to investigate alleged war crimes - but they have visited third-party countries. The OSI is the body set up to work with the Australian federal police on the investigation into alleged war crimes stemming from the Brereton inquiry into Australian special forces. The OSI director general, Chris Moraitis, confirmed that the 36 incidents referred to OSI from the Brereton inquiry all remained under active investigation – and the OSI was also investigating additional matters: Yes, senator, as well as other matters that have come to our attention beyond Brereton. Moraitis said OSI sought “evidence where we can” but would not go into operational details. Moraitis said they had not yet been able to travel to Afghanistan (the complicated issue of engagement with the Taliban is a matter for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). The Greens senator David Shoebridge asked whether OSI’s investigators had “travelled to countries outside of Australia except for Afghanistan for the purposes of contact with witnesses and investigators”. Moraitis replied: Without going into details, the answer is yes. (He did not say whether this included neighbouring countries such as Pakistan.) Moraitis also told the hearing he was comfortable with OSI’s resourcing. He said the current headcount was 128: We have the option of another 25 or so investigators. We don’t think we need that at the moment. In fact we’re quite happy with what we’ve got. He said OSI had been in close consultation with the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but at this stage had not provided any completed briefs of evidence to it. He would not indicate how many partial briefs of evidence provided to the DPP – he said he would “prefer not to” disclose that publicly because he was “still in the process of investigation [and] finalising elements”. Moraitis was vague about when he expected to send first completed brief of evidence to provided to DPP. If he was optimistic he would say “near future”, which he later clarified meant 2023. ABS data shows over 100,000 people moved to Queensland over the last five years (I think the headline for this AAP story should be that more Australians show good sense, but as a Queenslander, I would say that – Amy) Far more people are moving to Queensland than any other state or territory, while NSW recorded the biggest net loss, Australian Bureau of Statistics data shows. There was a net gain of more than 100,000 people to the sunshine state in the five years to 2021, according to internal migration numbers from the census. The biggest net loss was just south of the border, as 102,000 people moved out of NSW. There were more modest gains in Tasmania and the ACT, with net increases of 15,000 and 10,000 respectively, while almost 10,000 people left Victoria. Anecdotal stories of sea and tree changes are also backed up by the data, with a net loss of more than 160,000 from Australian capital cities. A senior staff member of the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority is alleged to have urinated on staff members at a function in Armidale in late 2021. He has now resigned, according to the APVMA’s chief executive, Lisa Croft, who was appearing before Senate estimates. After initially denying that there were any current investigations into sexual harassment within her agency, Croft confirmed that she was “ aware of the matter” and that those directly involved had talked to her about it soon after the incident. No official complaint was made. But she confirmed there had been discussions with HR and that the staff member – a member of the executive team – “resigned soon after the event,” she said. Croft insisted that the urination incident had occurred at a private event, not the office Christmas party as the Greens senator. Peter Whish-Wilson, had initially suggested in his question. The APVMA has struggled to retain staff since being moved to Armidale in 2015 by the former agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce, whose seat includes Armidale. It has been wracked by poor morale and high staff turnover as a result of the move. The minister for agriculture, Murray Watt, said he would be seeking an urgent briefing. These are very concerning questions. It is certainly the first time I have heard about it and I will be seeking an urgent briefing. Labor senator withdraws comment calling Bridget McKenzie ‘a naughty little girl’ It does not matter how frustrated you are, what your politics are, who it is directed towards, or what happened in the past – calling a woman “a naughty little girl” in a professional setting – the parliament no less, where the Respect at Work legislation was only just passed yesterday – is wildly inappropriate and the Labor senator Glenn Sterle deserved to be called out for it. Defence minister calls for ‘industrial base’ across Australia to support defence Richard Marles has spoken at the Submarine Institute of Australia conference, where he had a lot to say about, shockingly, submarines (the topic is kinda there in the title). What does Australia need to prepare for nuclear submarines (referring to Aukus)? Marles said: Before we say nuclear powered submarines, submarines are hugely complex machines, so the process that we have gone through as a country in terms of … working out what capabilities we have to build the Attack-class … is not wasted effort … That is still highly relevant to understand what capabilities we’ve got and what we can bring to bear in this. So I think before we talk about nuclear power, we are planning to build submarines in Australia still, and we’re planning to walk down that path pretty soon and pretty quickly. And so all the work that we had previously done in relation to getting people prepared to participate in Attack applies here. … there are all the issues that I described in relation to nuclear stewardship which we need to be thinking through … it’s kind of, I almost feel, above my paygrade, but it is just the concept that everything is more far more robust. And so we need to be thinking about that. And the final point I’ll make is, a lot of focus has been put on South Australia, that’s appropriate, that is where we will develop the capability to build submarines. WA is going to matter as well, it’s really going to matter. WA is obviously the home to our submarine fleet now [and] will continue to be that going forward and has I think, a very particular role play in the next few years. So we need to be thinking about our infrastructure there. And then the final point I’d make is that to do all of this actually requires a defence industrial base across the country, so, this is going to require a significant national [attention]. What impact have the recent rains had? Coalition looking for ‘sensible amendments’ to anti-corruption bill The Coalition is still hoping for “sensible amendments” to the government’s anti-corruption body, seemingly still committed to a higher bar for public hearings such as an independent judge’s approval. In the opposition party room meeting today, a major point of discussion was the national anti-corruption commission (Nacc). A parliamentary inquiry process is ongoing, and the Coalition’s party room spokesperson said the opposition had the “expectation” that some of their amendments would be advanced, including further safeguards around issues like public hearings. You might remember that the government’s bar for holding public hearings was that they should be “exceptional” circumstances only, which upset some crossbenchers and integrity bodies. The Coalition wanted an even higher threshold, calling for a senior judge to make that decision. The Coalition party room heard around five contributions on the Nacc, with members querying processes around public hearings and claiming the Nacc could be a “point of delay” for infrastructure projects. No decision was made on whether the Coalition would vote for or against the Nacc, based on the success of further amendments, but negotiations continue. Elsewhere, the opposition leader Peter Dutton called the budget a “stinker”, while David Littleproud described Dutton’s budget reply speech as a “watershed” moment. Littleproud also claimed the Labor government “aren’t talking about their budget at all”, which he said “spoke volumes” about cost of living pressures being felt by Australians. Contributions from the Coalition party room included short addresses on cuts to infrastructure funding in their electorates, gas prices, and the annual politicians vs press cricket game over the weekend (won easily by the pollies, thanks to a handy batting knock from several backbench Coalition MPs). ABC staff take issue with Sarah Henderson’s comments on working practices ABC staff are not holding back in correcting the record following some of Sarah Henderson’s comments and questions during senate estimates today. The senator often cites her experience working for the ABC, which occurred during the 1990s. (As an aside, kids who were born when Henderson left the ABC are now primed for their quarter-life crisis. Go well, Gen Z. You’ll get through it. We all do.) Coalition criticises apparent cuts to police and border force budgets Karen Andrews is going hard on cuts today – here is the shadow home affairs minister on what she says is cuts to the AFP’s budget: Today in Senate estimates, Australian Federal Police officials confirmed a cut of $18.46m to this crucial agency. Since coming to office in 2013, the Coalition increased total funding to the AFP to $1.7bn. In the March budget this year, the Coalition invested $170.4m to further develop the capabilities of the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force (ABF) over the next four years. This funding was aimed at hardening Australia’s border against transnational, serious and organised crime (TSOC) by increasing the number of ABF officers at seaports, airports and warehouses and boosting the AFP’s specialist operational, surveillance and criminal asset confiscation capabilities. Any cut to the AFP’s funding is an undermining of our national security and Labor needs to explain what program is now being underfunded by their short-sightedness. Daniel Hurst is listening to that estimates hearing, so I asked him for some context: The $18.46m figure is not a revelation from Senate estimates, although it was discussed during the hearing today. It appears in the AFP’s portfolio budget statement released at the time of the budget last month. What does it involve? The saving of $18.46m for the AFP is listed in 2022-23 as “savings from external labour, and savings from advertising, travel and legal expenses”. This is part of a government-wide cross-portfolio savings measure announced in the budget. However, the same document shows total resourcing for the AFP will increase from $1.88bn in 2021-22 to $1.98bn this financial year. Turns out even economists think it is time for government intervention when it comes to the energy sector: Eric Abetz may be gone from the senate, but his spirit in ABC estimates lives on. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, told the Labor caucus that he is “committed” to reforming the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, “an institution that has suffered serious harm over recent years”. The comment followed evidence in Senate estimates on Monday that there are 19 members who have had more than one bullying or harassment complaint made against them since 2016, including 17 who are still serving members. Dreyfus is meeting the AAT president this afternoon to discuss what measures have been put in place to deal with the complaints. At the National Press Club in October, Dreyfus used comments from Liberals complaining that the AAT could grant warrants to the National Anti-Corruption Commission to bolster the case to reform or replace the body. Dreyfus said: If ever you wanted a demonstration or a confirmation that something needs to be done about the AAT, there it was with these current members of the opposition attacking, in effect, the partisan appointments that they made with almost 90 failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers, former Liberal members of parliament that have been appointed. In June a Senate committee called for the AAT to be abolished and reconstituted as a new merits appeal body - something Dreyfus has never ruled out. His recent comments sound like he is contemplating something more extensive than just improving the appointment process. NSW parliament says companies should be able to claim back costs of transporting donated surplus food through tax system The NSW parliament has completed an inquiry into food production and supply and made a recommendation: That the NSW Government advocates for reform at the federal level to enable farmer and logistics companies to claim the cost of transporting donated surplus food as tax credits Now the food relief sector wants not just the NSW government to take up that recommendation, but all states and territories, to help make it easier for producers to donate excess stock: Foodbank, OzHarvest and SecondBite have joined forces to lobby governments to make the tax changes: The Foodbank Hunger Report 2022 highlighted that over 2 million Australian households were severely food insecure in the last 12 months, yet the country currently wastes more than 7.6 million tonnes of food each year, costing the economy over $36.6 billion. Of this food, 70% is perfectly edible and redirecting it to food relief would potentially deliver $2 billion in social return. Despite this, Australia’s current tax framework does not motivate food producers to donate excess stock. In fact, in tax terms, donating is no different to recycling or sending to landfill even though it may cost the company more. The tax incentive proposal, developed by KPMG with the support of the Fight Food Waste Cooperative Research Centre, recommends a two-tiered tax incentive based on the ability to offset a percentage of costs related to food donations from taxable income. Its aim is to encourage food producers to donate surplus product to food relief rather than sending it to landfill. The Australian federal police commissioner, Reece Kershaw, says his agency will have to step up its protection of high office holders because threats to politicians are increasing. At Senate estimates, Kershaw was asked about the prevalence of threats to MPs and their staff. He said: We are concerned. We’re seeing that around the globe, the threat to high office holders. Unfortunately it seems to be on the increase. Often it is through the online environment that threats are made. Kershaw said the AFP was working with Asio to review how assessments of threats are conducted. They’re a point in time - what can happen in a week can change quickly. He said the AFP was looking at restructuring the protective security command so that it would “coalesce” with its counter-terrorism command and sensitive investigations, “which will bring a whole new doctrine to that command”. Kerhsaw said there was a need to focus on the needs of individual MPs: Some MPs are more comfortable than others. Not that that changes our decision but I think, for us, we’re more and more going to be required to protect our high office holders. Kershaw said that there were “a record number of incidents” during the recent election period, but he did not go into details. He said data would be provided to the Senate committee notice. In Labor caucus, Anthony Albanese spoke about how the budget is being received, criticised Angus Taylor for not asking any questions to the treasurer, Jim Chalmers, and spoke about the need to get wages moving. He referred to the recent 15% rise in aged care pay and the national minimum wage decision, but didn’t mention the game of Senate chicken the government is engaged in with Senator David Pocock over the secure jobs, better pay bill. Albanese referred to evidence in the robodebt royal commission that the illegality of the scheme was known early on at least by officials. Albanese referred to Australia’s participation in the Cop27 climate summit, and how important it is for international relations, including the fact it was the first topic he and new UK prime minister, Rishi Sunak, discussed. Asked what impact the US midterms would have on climate action, Albanese said Australia will respect the outcome of democratic elections, but also noted that Biden’s climate agenda has already passed congress and is being implemented. The attorney general, Mark Dreyfus, said he would be meeting the Administrative Appeals Tribunal president this afternoon to discuss evidence of repeat bullying complaints by unnamed members. He reminded caucus he is committed to reforming the body, which he has criticised the Coalition for making partisan appointments to. The caucus agreed to a range of legislation: Allowing law enforcement and emergency agencies access to telco data for missing persons and natural disasters, not just cases involving imminent danger. Forgiving Help debts for doctors and nurses in regional areas, and other technical amendments to the jobs ready graduate scheme. Increasing penalty units from $222 to $275 Approving amendments to the secure jobs, better pay bill Labor will oppose Jacqui Lambie’s private senators bill implementing the veterans suicide royal commission recommendation to allow royal commissions to disregard parliamentary privilege. Being a Tuesday, the party room meetings were held. They have wrapped up – the house will sit from midday – so we will bring you some of what was said. For those who are new here, each of the parties meet on a Tuesday when parliament sits. The meetings are private, but in a very Canberra tradition, a briefing is held afterwards, where one of the MPs reads out the minutes from the meeting. Journalists can ask questions about what was spoken about, but no names are given – it is up to journalists to chase down who might have said what, if needed. The whole briefing is on “background” which means it is not attributed to anyone. It is another of the federal parliamentary reporting quirks which are tradition, but you don’t really find out about until you get here. Business confidence dropping sharply according to NAB survey As we noted in an earlier post, one target of the RBA’s higher interest rates is consumers, but the other is business. NAB’s monthly survey of conditions and confidence in October, also out this morning, revealed the former are holding up but the latter is ebbing. For those hoping for higher wages, there’s not much sign of that happening, with increases lower than in September. Business conditions were down only one point to 22, while profitability edged up by the same amount to 22 too. Workers, though, might have to wait for a bit more to come their way. NAB’s labour cost measure eased to a 3.1% increase in October, slowing from 3.8% during the September quarter. Note that July had a bit of a blip, with the minimum wage increase and superannuation changes. That means subsequent months, including October, will only have had moderate increases. Business confidence, meanwhile, sagged four points to be zero, meaning as many firms are pessimistic as optimistic about the future. NAB said: Confidence fell sharply in transport &amp; utilities, as well as in mining, manufacturing, finance, business &amp; property, recreation &amp; personal services, and wholesale. Victoria, which goes to the polls later this month, saw sentiment sag the most. Alan Oster, NAB’s top economist, said: Despite the strength in conditions, confidence has been falling for several months as headwinds have weighed on the outlook for the global economy and Australia. Could it be that workers will be asked to “tighten their belts” when things start to turn south, before they’ve had much loosening of said clothing accessory? Liberal senators demand to know salaries of high-paid and senior ABC staff A senate estimates committee descended into a shouting match today after Liberal senators demanded ABC managing director David Anderson provide the salaries of presenters and senior staff earning more than $230,000. Anderson refused on privacy grounds, but Liberal senator Sarah Henderson was not satisfied and insisted he had to answer every question asked of him by the senate. The MD was also asked about a speech Four Corners reporter Louise Milligan gave to a women’s legal event, which has been subject to criticism by the Australian newspaper. Henderson claimed some of the women who attended the event were upset by Milligan’s speech. Anderson said the speech was given by Milligan in a private capacity. After Milligan responded to Henderson’s claims on Twitter, the senators began talking about the reporter’s comments about the hearing. Federal police sought help from FBI for Medibank and Optus data breaches, AFP head says Over in the legal and constitutional affairs committee, the commissioner of the Australian federal police, Reece Kershaw, continues to face questions about recent high-profile data breaches. It has previously been confirmed that the AFP has sought help from the FBI in the Optus investigation. The Liberal senator James Paterson asked whether the AFP had also sought help from the FBI in the Medibank case – or just Optus. Kershaw confirmed the assistance of the US agency was sought in “both instances”: I can’t go into the specifics of the investigation but obviously having the strong linkage that we have with the bureau … is a positive in a sense of tracking down those people responsible. Paterson asks if the FBI is involved because of its capability or because of its jurisdiction and laws. Kershaw says: It’s both capability and also the intelligence space. These individuals and/or syndicates operate globally and we’re not just talking to the bureau - there are other police forces in the Five Eyes group. In particular as chair of the Five Eyes law enforcement group, we’ve sent that out to to partners, which is New Zealand, UK authorities, and the Canadians – so we’re going to unite the fight on this in particular on ransomware. Medibank has released a new statement: Medibank is today aware of media reports of a purported threat from a criminal to begin publishing stolen Medibank customer data online in 24 hours. The criminal could also attempt to contact customers directly. Medibank is working with the Australian Government, including the Australian Cyber Security Centre and the Australian Federal Police. The Australian Federal Police is investigating this cybercrime and trying to prevent the sharing and sale of our customers’ data. Medibank CEO, David Koczkar, said: “Customers should remain vigilant. We knew the publication of data online by the criminal could be a possibility, but the criminal’s threat is still a distressing development for our customers.” We unreservedly apologise to our customers. We take seriously our responsibility to safeguard our customers and support them. The weaponisation of their private information is malicious, and it is an attack on the most vulnerable members of our community,” he said. Overnight we again wrote to all customers to update them about this cybercrime. We continue to inform customers of what data we believe has been accessed or stolen and provide advice on what they should do. This is being done via email or letter and in some cases via phone. If you are contacted by someone who claims to have your data, or you are a victim of cybercrime, you can report it at ReportCyber on the Australian Cyber Security Centre website.

She ends up feeling comfortable wearing pants. It’s about individuality and expressing yourself. And given some children feel most comfortable wearing a bike helmet, swim cap, superhero costume or holding a spatula at times, is designed to let them know that expressing themselves is OK and normal. David Anderson continues in that hearing: I think children do dress up senator, and a story about dressing up is acceptable. Alex Antic kept pushing: Do you think this sort of content is contributing to the gender dysphoria problem in this country? Anderson: One, I [think] that complex issues that exist within Australian society … I don’t think we’re generating anything. If anything, the ABC reflects what is happening the Australian community. Antic: What percentage of Australian children are getting read to by people dressed like this, men dressed like this? Anderson: I don’t have the audience data with regard to that but what we have is a story about dressing up. South Australian Liberal senator Alex Antic has accused the ABC of “grooming” children, over a children’s story about dress-ups. Antic had issues with girls wearing pants, it appears, which Greens senator Sarah Hanson-Young called out, particularly over the language he was using. This is a rough transcript of what just happened in senate estimates, with ABC head David Anderson answering Antic’s “questions”. Antic: Mr Anderson, I have got a couple of questions about some programming matters and at the moment the ABC is airing a program called Courtney Act: The Spectacular Suit, in which a male drag actor, Shane Jenek, reads a children’s book called The Spectacular Suit, about a female child wanting to wear male clothing. The program was rated G and has been heavily promoted on TV and on the app. Why is the ABC grooming children with this sort of adult content? Anderson: Senator, I don’t see that as grooming children with our content. That particular program is reading from a book that is about dressing up so I think … Antic: Female children in male children’s clothing, you think that’s not ... Sarah Hanson-Young: You mean young girls wearing pants? Seriously. Antic: I have the call, thank you. Hanson-Young: Well it’s offensive. It is deeply, deeply offensive. Antic: If it’s offensive, you don’t have to hang around Sarah. You don’t have to hang around, Sarah, if you don’t want to. Hanson-Young: Heavens above – girls wearing pants. That is the level of rubbish you are putting forward. Antic: Okay. It is amazing what triggers a response. The truth. The truth that the ABC is grooming our children. Hanson-Young: It is offensive and it needs to be called out. Antic: You are welcome to leave. Hanson-Young: Grooming is a really serious matter! It is not for being played with by conservative senators to make headlines. Antic: That is what grooming looks like. Anderson: My answer is we are not grooming Australian children. Hanson-Young: Sexual assault survivors right around this country will be deeply offended, deeply offended by you playing politics. Anderson is asked to answer the question again: Anderson: I was simply refuting the fact that we were grooming Australian children. Because we are not grooming Australian children … What we are doing, that is about dressing up. Antic: Cross dressing. Let me ask you this, does ABC agree that transgender or cross dressing are adult concepts? Anderson: When it comes to transgender, yes, you can see there are people that wish to identify as a sex other than what they were born as, and I don’t accept what you are saying about somebody who is trans grooming Australian children. That’s not – that whole story time was not about that, it was about dressing up. Parliamentary expenses reporting delayed amid IT issues Expenses reporting for federal parliamentarians will be postponed as the Albanese government cites “severe” delays and major problems with the existing IT system. Senator Tim Ayres revealed the decision made by the special minister of state, Don Farrell, at a Senate estimates hearing this morning, and said the government would ask the auditor general to look into it. The “significant” problems affect the Parliamentary Expenses Management System, or Pems, which is billed as “a secure online portal” for parliamentarians and their staff to manage their office expenses. Ayres told the Finance and Public Administration Committee there had been issues in the development and implementation of the system since 2018. He said public expenditure reporting by parliamentarians was a “vital” transparency measure: It’s become apparent that the system is not progressing as intended and announced by the former government … Delays in the system are now so severe that although the system is functional and claims can continue to be made, they prevent these reports being created and populated. As a result, the government has been advised that significant time and additional work is required to rectify the system and to allow the established system of public reporting to continue. On the advice of the relevant agencies, the special minister of state [Farrell] has authorised a postponement of parliamentarian quarterly reports until the second half of 2023. This is not a decision that the minister has taken lightly. The requirement for public reporting is a key pillar of faith in our parliamentary system and the government has required relevant agencies to put every effort into rectification of this issue. In the government’s view, a fix is not enough. Maintaining transparency and integrity must be the highest priority. As such the special minister of state will write today to the Australian National Audit Office and suggest that this project be the subject of an audit or review should the auditor general deem it necessary. Ayres said Farrell would also write to every parliamentarian with information abut the system. He said briefings would be offered to all MPs and staff, starting with the shadow special minister of state, Jane Hume. Andrews government pledges free vehicle registration for Victorian apprentices The Andrews government has pledged to make vehicle registration free for Victorian apprentices, as part of a $9.7m cost-of-living election commitment. The Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, made the announcement at a vocational campus in Geelong on Tuesday morning. The government has also committed to establishing a parliamentary inquiry to crack down on bosses and contractors who refuse to pay sub-contractors if re-elected this month. Andrews said the vehicle registration scheme would save apprentices $865 a year and help incentivise people to take up vocational training: We think it’s a really practical, sensible thing to do. From that press conference: Q: Fortem said that got its contract by competitive tender, but the prime minister’s office said that’s not true. You were in government at the time. Can you clarify how that works? Karen Andrews: Yes, I can. So Fortem were engaged in a competitive tender process for the Black Summer fires. And as you heard John Bale say they were one of the final successful tenders. When we needed to look at an opportunity to build capability, we looked at how we could build scale here. Now, it’s the same thing that’s done with manufacturing. You start off with a level of funding and support and you build the scale. We need to build scale and support for our first responders. And that’s exactly what we did. So when we knew that we needed to build more capability, that we needed to make sure that our first responders were being appropriately looked after and cared for after the trauma that they themselves had experienced, we then looked at what we could do to scale it up. And Fortem already had the runs on the board. So this should not be a case of just dealing out small amounts of money to organisations. In Australia, we know that we have to build scale - or the Coalition understands the need to build scale - so there has been a process that has been successful in the past. So this is additional funding that builds on that process. Just to clarify there, it was by competitive tender at the time. My understanding of what happened with the Black Summer fires is that there was a process that was undertaken. It was managed, I believe, through a different department to Home Affairs or PMC but there was a competitive process. John Bale mentioned that when he spoke earlier this morning but I’m more than I’m sure that he is able to provide additional detail exactly of the process that he undertook. But he mentioned four organisations of which two of those were successful as a result of that process that was undertaken. Q: Why would the prime minister’s office then say there wasn’t? Andrews: I have no idea. That is a question for the prime minister (the answer does go on but that’s the relevant bit to the question that was asked) Coalition MPs have held a press conference about the decision to take funding away from Fortem, which provides mental health help to first responders. Karen Andrews: Prime minister Albanese and the Labor government have made a deliberate decision to rip funding away and support away from our first responders. This money was budgeted by the Coalition government and the reason that we provided that funding was to make sure that our first responders are supported. Now, our first responders are the people that are pulling people out of flooded waterways, that are pulling people out of fires, that are rescuing people from car crashes. These people are on the front line making sure that Australians are well looked after, and yet the Albanese Labor government has turned their backs on them by ripping away this funding. Now, this has enormous implications for the health and wellbeing of our first responders. This is a disgraceful decision by the prime minister. He needs to reverse it immediately. Just in case you missed it yesterday, one of the issues the attorney general is chasing up is the revelation of complaints within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which came out of estimates on Monday. Senator Nita Green: Thank you. How many members of the tribunal have had one or more bullying, harassment or discrimination complaint made about them since the first of July 2016? AAT chief operating officer, Jamie Crew: Nineteen members including senior members and deputy presidents have had more than one bullying, harassment or discrimination complaint made about them since 1 July 2016. Crew then gives more detail: So I think, Senator, we’ve provided some clarification about how we’ve interpreted that phrase. So we’ve interpreted the phrase more than to mean one or more, two or more, three or more, four or more ,five or more complaints received during that period. So more than one bullying complaint was 19 [people]. More than two was six [people]. More than three was three [people]; more than four was two [people]; and then more than five was one [person]. Extension of Collins class submarine lifespans to begin in 2026 The Royal Australian Navy’s director general of submarines, Commodore Tom Phillips, has spoken about the technically challenging plans to extend the life of the existing Collins class diesel-electric submarines. The life-of-type extension program begins in 2026 starting with HMAS Farncomb. Each upgrade will require extensive work and is expected to extend the life of each submarine by 10 years. This is intended to bridge any gap before the new nuclear-powered submarines under Aukus are ready. Phillips told the Submarine Institute of Australian conference in Canberra today that the purchase of items with long lead times for the extension of HMAS Farncomb had begun. He said he did not underestimate the technical challenges of the work: We’re full aware of the risk and technical challenge and we are bringing all forces to bear in the design effort to [reduce] that risk before 2026. Phillips also mentioned that the new east coast submarine base (the location has not yet been decided out of Newcastle, Port Kembla and Brisbane). He said the base would not only be a submarine base but would also support a range of other undersea capabilities. He said HMAS Stirling – the existing naval base in Western Australia – would remain a premier submarine base “for quite some time to go” and into the future (ie it will not be closed when the new base on the east coast opens). Consumer sentiment dims to first Covid wave levels If the theoretical framework underpinning the RBA’s rate rise binge is to cruel demand, last week’s seventh rise in borrowing costs in as many months seems to be having some of the desired effect. The latest weekly survey of consumer sentiment by the ANZ and Roy Morgan shows the sixth decline in a row, bringing the gauge to levels not seen since April 2020 when the first Covid wave was cresting. David Plank, ANZ’s head of Australian economics, says most measures were lower, including the economic conditions next year subindex, which has sagged 17% over the past nine weeks. What the RBA wants to see, though, is falling expectations about how high inflation will go. Alas, that arrow is still pointed in the wrong direction. Those concerns are now at their highest level since the data series began in April 2010. One slightly contrary mood, though, is a rise in consumer confidence among those paying off their mortgage, with the gauge up 2.6%. That sentiment may not keep rising if the markets are any guide, though. Investors are predicting the RBA will hike again next month (with a two-thirds chance of another 25 basis-point rise to 3.1%.) If the market’s right, the cash rate will top 4% in about a year’s time (though most economists predict the RBA will stop well shy of that). Labor announces $5m to encourage women to run for office Katy Gallagher has announced $5m over five years to boost the number of women in public office. The women in public office grant is designed to encourage – and prepare – more women to run for elections at all levels. From the minister’s release: Projects will address barriers to entering office and provide women candidates with a clear understanding of political process and candidate expectations. Applications will need to clearly demonstrate that activities have no political affiliations or agendas, and are accessible to all women across the political spectrum. Eligible organisations currently delivering programs, initiatives and resources that encourage and prepare women to run for public office are invited to apply. Proposed projects must complement or expand, and not duplicate, existing programs aimed at helping women gain public office positions. The Women in Public Office grant opportunity opens on Tuesday 8 November 2022 and closes Monday 19 December 2022. A virtual information briefing will be hosted by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet’s Office for Women from 10am to 11:30am on Wednesday 16 November.

In the New South Wales parliament today, the Greens will introduce a bill to ban native forestry operations in koala habitat. The bill would amend forestry laws to make logging an offence in areas of regional koala significance. The NSW Greens environment spokesperson, Sue Higginson, said the bill was an essential step to saving koalas from extinction: If the government was serious about protecting koalas or any of our native animals threatened with extinction then they could introduce a bill to do so – just like I am doing today. It would save NSW money and save many of our forest-dependent threatened species from extinction by taking a proactive approach to a looming crisis for industry and nature. It is unclear whether the bill will be debated before the NSW parliament wraps up for the year ahead of the March election but the Greens say they will reintroduce the legislation next year regardless of who wins government. The Greens federal environment spokesperson, Sarah Hanson-Young, said the bill to end forestry operations in koala habitat was a step towards what was ultimately needed in NSW, which was an end to all native forest logging: There must be an end in sight to this destructive industry, for the sake of our precious forests and the wildlife that call them home. In federal parliament, the Greens have proposed legislation that would put a moratorium on clearing of critical koala habitat. Liberal senator says teal independents were ‘bought and paid for by some of Australia’s richest people’ James Paterson was also salty about the amount of money Climate 200 raised: I thought it was extraordinary that the Climate 200 movement raised about $13m and that more than a third of that, almost $5m, came from just three political donors. If the Liberal party collected that much donations from that many high net worth individuals, or the Labor party collected that much donations from the union movement, there would be outrage and the loudest criticisms would be coming from the crossbenchers and the teals. They would say this is democracy being bought by rich people and they’d be outraged. So, I think they need to reflect on what they told the electorate and what they’ve been saying for months, which is that they’re supposedly a people-powered movement with thousands of grassroots donors. Now we know the truth. They are bought and paid for by some of Australia’s richest people who stand to benefit from the policies that they advocate. He says the phenomenal amounts of money the major parties raise, including the Liberals, is different because they contest more electorates. If they contested every electorate in the country and spent as much as they did in those electorates, they would massively outspend us. It’s extraordinary to be spending $2m or thereabouts on a single seat. Most Liberal party candidates, including MPs who are re-elected, spend nowhere near that amount of money. This is an extraordinary amount of money, an unusual amount of money, and it is an innovation that teals have brought to our political system despite their criticism of money in politics. There didn’t seem to be the same criticism for Clive Palmer’s spend. The Liberal senator James Paterson also says looking at officially banning ransom payments is something the parliament might need to consider. He held a brief doorstop (a quick press conference) where he said: People do advocate from time to time the banning of ransom payments. I think that’s something the parliament needs to carefully consider. It certainly is the advice of the Australian government consistently not to pay ransom because there is no guarantee that you’ll get your data back and you are contributing to others being hacked in the future by paying ransom. So, I think that’s something the parliament needs to consider. Women and children recently repatriated from Syria will continue to be assessed by AFP and counter-terror teams, says AFP boss Reece Kershaw also addressed the recent repatriation of women and children from Syria as part of Operation Ammersoyen-Alsunga. Kershaw said: Our established relationships offshore also assisted with the repatriation of four women and 13 children from detention camps in north-east Syria. The individuals who recently returned to Australia will continue to be assessed by the AFP and our partners through our joint counter terrorism teams. I have confidence in the well-established framework that enables the AFP to respond and manage extremist threats in Australia, including our community liaison teams, which will work with community leaders to support these returned individuals. The Liberal senator Paul Scarr is asking the AFP whether it is investigating the unauthorised disclosure of information about the operation to the Australian newspaper. Kershaw said the AFP requires a “harm statement” to assess whether the leak is worth investigating. “We’re going through that process now,” he said. The AFP commissioner, Reece Kershaw, has opened Senate estimates with a statement about the Optus and Medibank data breaches. Kershaw said: As chair of the Five Eyes Law Enforcement Group, which includes agencies from the US, UK, New Zealand and Canada, I know partnerships are crucial in combating cybercrime. The FBI is assisting in the AFP-led Operational Hurricane, which is focused on identifying the perpetrator or perpetrators responsible for the Optus data breach. The AFP is also leading Operation Guardian, which has the objective of protecting more than 10,000 Optus customers, whose identification credentials were unlawfully released online. Recently, a Sydney man was charged under Operation Guardian for allegedly attempting to blackmail Optus customers. He faces up to 10 years’ imprisonment. We also launched Operation Pallidus to investigate the data breach against Medibank Private and Operation Allora to investigate the MyDeal data breach. The AFP has invested significant resources into these investigations, which will be long and complex. And apart from sending a warning to cybercriminals that the AFP will relentlessly pursue them, I also have a message to business: please alert authorities immediately when a data breach is suspected. It’s like any crime scene. The longer it takes relevant agencies to be informed, the harder it is for perpetrators to be identified, disrupted or brought to justice. ‘Profoundly important’ to convey Aukus submarines’ strategic advantage to Australian public, deputy PM says The deputy prime minister, Richard Marles, has implicitly acknowledged that the government will have to persuade the public of the need to spend vast sums of money on nuclear-powered submarines under Aukus. Australia, the US and the UK are expected to conclude their work early next year to determine the way for Australia to acquire at least eight nuclear-powered submarines. Speaking at a Submarine Institute of Australia conference in Canberra this morning, Marles reiterated his view about what submarines could deliver in a strategic sense: We are buying a large question mark in an adversary’s mind. But Marles said he saw it as “profoundly important” to convey that message to the Australian public, “so that people can understand why we are spending an enormous amount of money” on a a comparatively small number of platforms. (The cost of the new submarines is not yet known, but previous estimates by analysts have put it well north of $100bn. This all comes at a time of budgetary and economic pressure.) The cybercriminals allegedly behind the Medibank data breach have threatened to start releasing some of the data they took now that Medibank have refused to pay the ransom (a position backed by the government). The Liberal senator James Paterson told Sky News it was a worrying time: I think the unfortunate thing about the Medibank crisis is that the company’s understanding of the attack has evolved. And yesterday I asked the information commissioner before the Senate estimates about that and she said that’s a matter of active investigation because it is important that companies disclose what they know when they know it, and it will be important to understand whether Medibank has done that. But that’s kind of for after the crisis. We just need to get through the crisis at this stage. I understand that Medibank is cooperating with the Australian Cyber Security Centre, who will be also appearing before Senate estimates this afternoon, and we’ll discuss that further with them. It’s critical that they continue their cooperations to protect their customers as best they can. David Pocock continues to support splitting IR bill The ACT senator David Pocock has spoken to ABC Canberra about what changes he would like to see in the government’s industrial relations bill. Pocock has proposed splitting the bill to pass the low-paid and cooperative multi-employer bargaining streams this year, and deal with the more controversial “single-interest” stream next year. Asked what changes he would like, Pocock said: The stream that is causing the most grief is the single-interest [stream] ... so we’re looking more at that and I’ll be waiting to see the details of these amendments that have been flagged. There’s a Senate committee process still under way ... There’s three more, three more, full days of Senate committee hearings. And then the committee will hand down its report. And the minister’s already flagged that there will likely be amendments from that. And for the ACT, we’re a city of small businesses. We have to ensure that we are getting wages moving. And also looking after small businesses ensuring that the system is is simple enough to work for them and be understandable. And one of the issues that has been raised by small business, across the ACT is the definition of a small business, being 15 headcount, not 15 full-time equivalent. Which potentially scoops up a huge number of, you know, smaller cafes and all sorts across the territory. Small businesses are exempted from being compelled by their employees to join a multi-employer pay deal, so changing the definition to 15 full-time equivalent, not 15 employees, would broaden that safeguard. Monarchist league chair says government’s republican ‘scheming’ amounts to ‘acts of deceit … worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy’ The national chair of the Australian Monarchist League, Philip Benwell, is quite agitated by the idea that King Charles III may not appear on the $5 note. It is the decision of Dr Philip Lowe, as the governor of the reserve bank, but Lowe is consulting with the government. Last week, treasurer Jim Chalmers said he would like to see an Australian on the note. Benwell is outraged and thinks removing the regent’s image from the note is the first step towards a campaign to make Australia become a republic (which is not something the government is planning for this term, but is on the agenda for any potential future terms): There was a time when, following an election, people thought that a government in power was for all people, but obviously not this government which obviously intends to embark upon a Keating-style campaign of republican attrition commencing with the removal of the monarch’s image from the $5 note. One wonders how Mr Albanese and his cohorts will be able to face the monarch in the eye when they rush to London to attend his coronation when, at the same time, they are scheming to get rid of him. These acts of deceit are worthy of a Shakespearean tragedy. How duplicitous could anyone be? Firstly they dump the King from Australia’s $5 note and then pay homage to the King on a taxpayer-funded cavalcade of exclusivity costing the people upwards of a million dollars, better spent on reducing the cost of living for ordinary Australians. Meanwhile, Bridget McKenzie still has this to deal with: Opposition expected to focus on redirected regional funds in budget estimates Budget estimates is back on today and the opposition are focusing on where money has been taken from regional Australia as part of the redirection of funds. Labor scrapped the funds which the previous government had given Barnaby Joyce and the Nationals as a balm for supporting Scott Morrison’s net zero by 2050 target. A joint release from Coalition MPs was sent this morning on some of the funds which have been redirected: The Coalition Government backed in our essential first responders by providing $10 million over two years to charity organisation Fortem Australia, for essential mental health and wellbeing support for those assisting during natural disasters. However, Labor’s first Budget ripped $8 million in funding from the organisation, which means they are unable to open services in important regional locations like Townsville, Ballina, Albury-Wodonga, Gippsland, Dubbo, Nowra, Newcastle, Sunshine Coast, Darwin, Launceston and Perth. Labor is ripping money from regional Australia, just like they did with the Building Better Regions Fund. Labor’s blatant carelessness for the wellbeing of our first responders needs immediate rectification. The Opposition is calling on Labor to urgently reverse this funding cut. Expect to see more of that. Allegra Spender: Neither major party took available chance to change political donation regime Allegra Spender said she believed a citizens’ assembly (like a big jury) should be involved in setting the rules for election spending and fundraising. Why? I think because people don’t trust politicians to make up the rules for their own political funding their campaigns. I believe that if we actually listen to everyday people’s, you know – get together a group, a bit like a jury, of just people from broad parts of Australia, and said, ‘Okay, how do you believe politics should be funded’, and they were given the time and resources to really debate that … then I believe that [we could] come up with some great outcomes. You see that very much in – we’ve seen other countries like Ireland use that same model to debate something really contentious, which was the abortion laws, and come up with a community something that was backed by the whole community. I think, if you can really put politics back in the hands of the community – if you can do politics differently, then I think we will all be better off for it. And so that’s why I’m a strong advocate for that approach to resolve political donations, because, you know, both major parties have had a chance to change the political donation regime, and neither of them have made the major changes. You know, both of them could have stopped Clive Palmer spending over $100m on political donations, but they haven’t. And so I think this is a change. I think that we could really see a fundamental shift in political funding. Allegra Spender was also asked about how much money she and some of the other independents spent on their election campaigns. She said: It was, I know, it was an expensive campaign … For me, I think the biggest difference, however, was the volunteers. So we had over 1,500 volunteers in our campaign who, you know – when you ask people [about] what made the difference, it’s people … the visibility of people who said, I care about climate change, I care about integrity, I care about a future-focused economy and I’m going to support an independent … So I’m really proud of of the volunteers and I’m very grateful for the donations as well because honestly, if you’re in an independent and you need it’s a lot just to be known in the community. That takes a lot of time. But I also agree with you, PK, and I believe we should fundamentally reform how we do political spending, but I can’t do that on my own. You actually need to get that across the parliament. And that’s something that I’m going to be driving as part of my time here. It does have to be said, though, that small businesses don’t tend to be unionised, even when a majority of Australians were unionised (which was about 30 or so years ago). The bill does not cover businesses with less than 15 employees, or those with their own enterprise bargaining agreements. So that takes out a whole heap of small businesses. Plus, a majority of employees in that small business would have to vote to take part in multi-employer bargaining. So there are some protections in there for small businesses. It is also worth noting that a lot of the big business lobby groups are spending a lot of time advocating for small business in this debate. Which they don’t represent. The Senate won’t sit until parliament resumes in a couple of weeks. It’s going to be an interesting time. Wentworth independent MP Allegra Spender is now speaking to ABC radio RN Breakfast and she is raising her concerns with the IR bill being rushed. The government doesn’t need the crossbench in the house – it has the numbers itself. But it would be a very brave government indeed to ignore such a strong crossbench, which was elected by constituents who wanted politics done differently. Spender says she is concerned with unintended consequences and everyone just needs more time to examine things like multi-employer bargaining: Look, I believe, honestly that we should split the bill. I think there are elements of the bill that are particularly focused on low paid workers. And on feminised industries and around gender equity, that I believe there’s a lot of consensus around, you know, there’s business and unions have been working together on these areas for a long time and I think we could pass those parts of the bill by Christmas. It is particularly however, the multi sector employer bargaining and particularly the piece where it’s forced bargaining buyers, you know, businesses that have never been forced into multi employer bargains. I think we should take a really big pause on and look at the legislation in detail, because industrial relations legislation is some of the most complicated in our history, and you just need to see that you know, so many problems, actually, with the Fair Work Act are being trying to fix in this legislation, because there were problems in their Fair Work Act, which actually made it hard for businesses and workers to bargain together. So I think we should be very cautious because otherwise you’re going to end up with a lot of unintended consequences. But Tony Burke also concedes there that there won’t be a vote on the IR bill “for a couple of weeks”. That is government code for – we aren’t close enough to having the votes yet. Patricia Karvelas puts to Tony Burke Jacqui Lambie’s statement that it will be a “miracle” to have the bill past by Christmas. Burke laughs and says the miracle might be getting Lambie across the line, but he’s not giving up on any option: She’s made her own views really clear. And I don’t think anyone’s got a better turn of phrase than Jacqui Lambie when it comes to the parliament. There have been lots of occasions where things have looked to be impossible and the parliament has ended up finding a way. And I’ll tell you if there was an issue where we should be trying to find a way right now, it’s at the core of the cost-of-living challenges. A whole lot of the inflationary pressures are international. There’s some we can do things about; there’s a lot that we can’t. We can do something about wages, and we really need to. Tony Burke: The pressure that is being felt is real. The sooner we act, the sooner pay will go up. And that’s why I’m doing everything I can to try to make sure we can get those wages moving for Australians this year. Tony Burke doesn’t want to take out the single-interest stream as yet because “I want to get wages moving for as many people as possible”. The single-interest stream is one part of multi-employer bargaining – the bill authorises workers with common interests to bargain together, where it is in the public interest for them to do so (thanks, Paul). That’s what David Pocock wants carved out, so he can have more time to consult. That’s what the government doesn’t want to move on. If you are looking for an explainer on the legislation we’ll be talking about today, Paul Karp has you covered: Tony Burke is also being quite conciliatory about David Pocock’s concerns about the bill. Asked by Patricia Karvelas if he is prepared to make more amendments to the IR bill, Tony Burke says that is standard after a senate inquiry process. So yes, there will be more amendments, Burke says. I suspect there’ll be more to come. Tony Burke is quick off the blocks this morning – he will be on ABC radio RN Breakfast very soon. A new survey suggests around one in three Australians, or more than 6 million people, have fallen victim to a data breach in the last year, with young people the most likely to have their information exposed. The latest round of the ANUpoll, from the Australian National University, found an overwhelming percentage of people backed stronger penalties against companies not adequately protecting data, and better regulation from government. It comes in the wake of high-profile breaches experienced by customers of Optus, Medibank and more, with the federal government promising tighter data rules and bigger penalties for errors. The representative poll of nearly 3,500 Australians, released on Tuesday, asked “‘Have you, or a member of your household, been the victim of a data breach in the last 12 months?” Some 31.2% of men and 32.8% of women responded yes. Prof Nicholas Biddle, from the ANU Centre for Social Research and Methods, said: Roughly one third of adult Australians, or around 6.4 million people, have been the victim of a breach in the last 12 months. In comparison our survey found only 11.2 per cent of Australians had been the victim of serious crimes like burglary or assault in the last five years. As our lives become more and more dominated by data, so too does our exposure to data related crime. This is a serious issue that needs serious attention. The poll found that the most likely group to become data breach victims was the 25-34 age bracket, with around 41.5% saying they’d been exposed. More than 96% of respondents said they wanted to see significant penalties against companies “that do not adequately protect consumer data”, Biddle said: And 92.8 per cent of Australian adults think government regulation of new technologies is crucial for consumer protection. At the same time, 90.6 per cent think government should regulate companies’ use of data. Breaches like the Optus breach clearly impact on trust in the whole system of data governance, and Australians are crying out for stronger regulation and better protection. Sticking with the defence strategic review, and the university sector has warned of critical skills shortages including in cybersecurity fields. Universities Australia released its submission to the defence strategic review overnight and said Defence was “not immune to the skills crisis rippling through our economy”: Skill shortages are plaguing many areas of our defence force, defence industries and complementary sectors, with the shortfall of cybersecurity professionals alone tipped to hit up to 30,000 unfilled positions over the next four years. Universities Australia’s submission sets out proposals to address Defence’s workforce challenges. These include expanding the Defence University Sponsorship Program to sponsor individual students to study a full Defence-relevant degree (rather than having them apply after one year) at any Australian university, The sector also suggests offering students a broader range of internships and work integrated learning experiences; reconsidering the eligibility requirements for Defence internships; making it easier for non-university-educated workers to transition to university study; and boosting research partnerships between Defence and regional universities. The chief executive of Universities Australia, Catriona Jackson, said university-educated workers across all the disciplines – in STEM, humanities and social sciences – would be central to building Australia’s defence capability: The success of security pacts like the Aukus arrangement hinge on the capacity of these researchers and highly skilled workers. A new report warns that the forthcoming defence strategic review faces an “exploding suitcase” of challenges. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute report says the leaders of the review, Angus Houston and Stephen Smith, are tasked with delivering new military acquisitions faster in the next decade, but it says the existing acquisition plan is “probably already unaffordable”: That is, more funding will likely be necessary even before additional capabilities are added to the shopping list ... And with nuclear-powered submarines and frigates on the untouchable list, the challenge of delivering more sooner gets even harder, as those two projects will consume tens of billions of dollars over the coming decade even before they deliver their first vessels. The report’s author, senior analyst Marcus Hellyer, provided an update on the state of defence funding following the October budget: Defence is facing the same challenge as Australian mums and dads: inflation is rapidly eroding buying power. While on paper Defence is getting a 7% budget increase in 2022-23, once we take inflation into account it’s only around 1%. That’s probably not enough to afford its shopping list of new equipment. There’s no pot of gold available to cover increased defence spending. That doesn’t mean the government can’t or won’t increase defence spending once it gets the DSR’s recommendations, but any increase will require either higher taxes (which appears unlikely, since the government is proceeding with its predecessor’s planned tax cuts), greater borrowing (accelerating the vicious cycle of debts and deficits), or cuts to other priorities that have constituencies of their own. (ASPI receives funding from defence but says its editorial judgments are independent.) Gaetjens report into sports rorts criticises ‘lack of transparency’ A little bit more on that Gaetjens report which is sure to garner a lot of reaction this morning after it was finally obtained last night through that FOI request, two years after the investigation by the former head of the prime minister’s department. These are the key quotes from Phil Gaetjens relating to decisions made by then sports minister Bridget McKenzie that brazenly channelled funding to Coalition electorates. Gaetjens wrote: This lack of transparency coupled with the significant divergences between projects recommended by Sport Australia and those approved by the minister has given rise to concerns about the decision making. The report also states: Those submitting grant funding applications had, in my view, a right to more fully understand the basis on which the funding decisions were being made. Our reporter Jordyn Beazley has been talking to people who have turned to buy now, pay later credit schemes to get them through the cost of living crisis. They describe how it can be a tempting fix but can soon lead to much greater financial strife. Experts fear the schemes, which have mushroomed in recent years, will leave more and more people stuck in a “revolving door” of bad debt. Read her full report here: Welcome to Tuesday, also known as ‘the government starts the IR fight in earnest’ day. Tony Burke will be introducing the amendments (concessions) the government has made on the bill, but the government is still trying to push it through on a very tight timetable. It wants the bill passed by the end of the sittings – which is essentially just two weeks – and two of the senators the government needs, Jacqui Lambie and David Pocock, want more time. For those who need a refresher, here are the main amendments Burke will be introducing today; Requiring majority support from employees of each employer for a single interest bargaining stream authorisation. Providing that businesses and workers cannot be compelled into an authorisation or single interest employer agreement when they have agreed to bargain for a proposed single enterprise agreement, and a six-month grace period where there is a history of effective bargaining. Making further changes to the Better Off Overall Test to ensure new employees under an agreement are not left worse off; Clarifying that the Fair Work Commission must be satisfied a minimum period of good-faith bargaining has occurred before moving to arbitrate; Establish the government’s promised new national construction industry forum as a statutory advisory body. Giving business 12 months to adjust to changes to fixed-term contracts. But Lambie and Pocock still don’t want to rush. They want to split the bill, which the government does not want to do. Meanwhile, the resources industry is preparing a multimillion-dollar campaign arguing against the IR changes. There is still the rumour that the parliament, or at least the senate, will sit for another week in early December, given there is so much for the senate to get through. If that happens, it would give the government another week to negotiate for the numbers it needs to pass IR. But that, I understand, is still a last resort. We’ll see how today plays out. Meanwhile, the Australian Strategic Policy Institute warns the defence strategic review faces an “exploding suitcase” of issues, including cost, Daniel Hurst reports. It seems inflation is also affecting the defence force’s buying power. Yet another issue the government needs to deal with, and one that already comes with a whole bunch of political landmines. Good times ahead. And of course, we still have budget estimates. Because there is no such thing as too much fun. We will cover all of the day’s events and more. You have the Canberra team of Katharine Murphy, Sarah Martin, Paul Karp, Josh Butler and Dan Hurst at your disposal, and me, Amy Remeikis on the blog. Mike Bowers sends his love as he works on some other projects. Guardian Australia’s exceptionally hardworking team around the country will keep you up to date with what is happening outside of the federal parliament – we’ll make sure you are all across any breaking news. I have already had three coffees. It’s only Tuesday and I am already out of coffee grounds. Ready? Let’s get into it. Good morning. Welcome to the Australia politics blog. Amy Remeikis will be along soon to take you through the day but before then here’s a quick roundup of the stories making news this morning. The secret report by the former Coalition government into the sports rorts scandal has criticised the decision-making process by former sports minister Bridget McKenzie and its “lack of transparency”. The findings by former top public servant Phil Gaetjens were kept secret for two years but have been revealed by a freedom of information request. Sewage leaks into flood waters are being blamed for “massive fish kills” along parts of the Murray River system in northern Victoria. Authorities have warned residents to stay clear of the water which some believe has been contaminated with human waste in the wake of the catastrophic flooding events of the past few weeks. The aftermath of natural disasters are also a key focus at the Cop27 climate summit that began in Egypt overnight. As around 100 world leaders gathered in the Red Sea resort of Sharm el-Sheikh, they were told by the UN chief, Antonio Guterres, that the globe was on a “highway to climate hell”. But the devil will be in the detail at the two-week talks, with the thorniest issue being “loss and damage” funding for developing countries hit by climate-related disasters. Chris Bowen will be representing the federal government. Follow our live coverage of the summit here and there’s lots more coverage of the event here.

But clues to their fractured relationship were evident as early as August 2020, when the notoriously prickly DeSantis denounced as “<a href=\"https://floridapolitics.com/archives/354787-phony-narrative-ron-desantis-says-donald-trump-does-not-dictate-floridas-virus-response/\">a phony narrative</a>” an assertion he was the then president’s “yes man” in Florida.</p> <p>The governor subsequently criticized Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying earlier this year he regretted “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/14/politics/desantis-trump-covid-response\">not speaking out</a>” sooner against Trump’s call for a nationwide lockdown. In response, Trump called DeSantis “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/trump-desantis-covid-boosters/index.html\">gutless</a>” for refusing to reveal if he had been given a Covid booster vaccine.</p> <p>In June, Trump began readying his anti-DeSantis rhetoric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/21/trump-desantis-2024-president-win\">telling the New Yorker</a> he would beat his rival in a nomination contest and claiming it was only his endorsement that revived the three-term congressman’s faltering campaign for governor in 2017.</p> <p>Now, with the distraction of the midterms almost out of the way, and with Trump seeking a clear run for his third presidential run as a Republican, DeSantis too has been granted a derogatory nickname.</p> <p>DeSantis’s apparent focus on 2024 – notwithstanding reports he has told donors he may wait until 2028, when Trump will be out of the way – became an issue during the governor’s debate in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/florida\">Florida</a> last month. Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee, repeatedly challenged DeSantis to say if he would commit to a full four-year term if re-elected.</p> <p>Seizing on DeSantis’s refusal to answer, Crist said: “It’s not a tough question. It’s a fair question. He won’t tell you.”</p> <p>DeSantis described Crist, a Republican Florida governor turned Democratic congressman, “a worn out old donkey” he was looking to “put out to pasture”.</p> <p>At the Miami rally on Sunday, Trump declined to criticize DeSantis again but offered only tepid support for him in Tuesday’s elections, compared to his comments about Rubio and other <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/republicans\">Republicans</a> in congressional and state races.</p> <p>“You’re going to re-elect the wonderful, the great friend of mine, Marco Rubio to the United States Senate. And you are going to re-elect <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/ron-desantis\">Ron DeSantis</a> as your governor,” Trump said.</p> </blockquote> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/07/trump-desantis-republican-party-analysis\">Expect the Trump-DeSantis animosity to evolve into open warfare after midterms</a> </p> </aside> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-07T23:31:40.315Z\">at 11.31pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636989888f08e60db1d417e4\" class=\"block\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-07T22:46:47.669Z\">10.46pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>    <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>The Republican rally for <strong>JD Vance</strong> has begun in Dayton, Ohio, and Republican candidate for the House of Representatives <strong>JR Majewski</strong> has taken the stage expressing hope that Trump will announce his bid for reelection. “Folks I can’t wait to see Trump Force One come on down the tarmac and I hope we hear the announcement that we’ve been waiting for: Trump 2024.”<br><br>Majewski, who started his speech by saying his pronouns were “patriot” and “ass kicker” also called Nancy Pelosi “drunk” and “nasty” and “dared” Democrat candidate for Ohio senate Tim Ryan to come to the rally. “Timmy if you’re watching, and I know you are, there’s a whole lot of Maga going on in Dayton, Ohio, and you should come on down here, I double-dog dare you.”</p>  <figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1589747666720018432\">  <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-conversation=\"none\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">JR Majewski is already smearing &quot;that drunk, nasty Nancy Pelosi&quot; at the Trump rally in Dayton, Ohio, and basically challenging Tim Ryan to a fight <a href=\"https://t.co/kopAydz3UA\">pic.twitter.com/kopAydz3UA</a></p>&mdash; Aaron Rupar (@atrupar) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/atrupar/status/1589747666720018432?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 7, 2022</a></blockquote>  </figure> </div>   <p class=\"block-time updated-time\">Updated <time datetime=\"2022-11-07T22:49:51.730Z\">at 10.49pm GMT</time></p>  </div> <div id=\"block-636983778f0857d62bd021c5\" class=\"block is-key-event\" data-block-contributor=\"\"> <p class=\"block-time published-time\"> <time datetime=\"2022-11-07T22:24:43.598Z\">10.24pm <span class=\"timezone\">GMT</span></time> </p>   <h2 class=\"block-title\">President Joe Biden says Maga Republicans are &quot;some of the darkest forces&quot; in US history</h2>  <div class=\"block-elements\">  <p>In another <strong>DNC</strong> virtual reception on Monday afternoon, <strong>President Joe Biden </strong>said the Democrats were “up against some of the darkest forces we’ve ever seen in our history”, according to a White House Pool report from the Guardian’s David Smith. “These Maga Republicans are a different breed of cat.

My colleagues will be keeping an eye on the Ohio rally for any impending announcements. Otherwise here’s what happened today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s first interview since the attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, last month by a seemingly-unhinged, rightwing conspiracy theory-spouting assailant will be broadcast tonight by CNN at 8pm. Donald Trump has appealed a judge’s order to install a watchdog at the Trump Organization family business before a civil fraud case by the state’s attorney general goes to trial. Rumors are swirling that Trump could announce his 2024 presidential bid tonight when he appears at a rally for Senate candidate JD Vance in Dayton, Ohio, on the eve of the midterm elections, where Republicans hope to shine. Twitter owner Elon Musk posted on his social media platform endorsing the Republicans in the midterm elections. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, head of the so-called Wagner mercenary group fighting on Russia’s side in the invasion of Ukraine, said today he had interfered in US elections and would continue doing so in future. It’s the last full day of election campaigning before the big vote tomorrow. US president Joe Biden and former president and Republican beacon Donald Trump will be out on the trail tonight in a contest where so much is at stake for each of their parties – and American democracy. President Joe Biden says Democrats were “up against some of the darkest forces we’ve ever seen in our history”, according to a White House Pool report from the Guardian’s David Smith. “These Maga Republicans are a different breed of cat. This is not your father’s Republican party.” Texas senator Ted Cruz was hit with a beer can while riding a float during the Houston Astros victory parade on Monday. AP is reporting that an Arizona judge has blocked the hand count of early ballots. Republicans pushed for the count because they claimed they do not trust the voting machines. The move is among more than 100 pre-election lawsuits filed by Republicans around the ways votes are casted or counted. A man was arrested after Texas senator Ted Cruz was hit with a beer can while riding a float during the Houston Astros victory parade on Monday, according to Houston police department. Cruz and his companions were also met with mass boos from the crowd. With Trump’s appearance at the Ohio rally looming, Richard Luscombe provides a look at the evolving animosity developing between the former president and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is poised to be the most likely challenger to Trump if he chooses to run for reelection. Luscombe writes: Until now, DeSantis and Trump have mostly kept each other at arm’s length. But clues to their fractured relationship were evident as early as August 2020, when the notoriously prickly DeSantis denounced as “a phony narrative” an assertion he was the then president’s “yes man” in Florida. The governor subsequently criticized Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying earlier this year he regretted “not speaking out” sooner against Trump’s call for a nationwide lockdown. In response, Trump called DeSantis “gutless” for refusing to reveal if he had been given a Covid booster vaccine. In June, Trump began readying his anti-DeSantis rhetoric, telling the New Yorker he would beat his rival in a nomination contest and claiming it was only his endorsement that revived the three-term congressman’s faltering campaign for governor in 2017. Now, with the distraction of the midterms almost out of the way, and with Trump seeking a clear run for his third presidential run as a Republican, DeSantis too has been granted a derogatory nickname. DeSantis’s apparent focus on 2024 – notwithstanding reports he has told donors he may wait until 2028, when Trump will be out of the way – became an issue during the governor’s debate in Florida last month. Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee, repeatedly challenged DeSantis to say if he would commit to a full four-year term if re-elected. Seizing on DeSantis’s refusal to answer, Crist said: “It’s not a tough question. It’s a fair question. He won’t tell you.” DeSantis described Crist, a Republican Florida governor turned Democratic congressman, “a worn out old donkey” he was looking to “put out to pasture”. At the Miami rally on Sunday, Trump declined to criticize DeSantis again but offered only tepid support for him in Tuesday’s elections, compared to his comments about Rubio and other Republicans in congressional and state races. “You’re going to re-elect the wonderful, the great friend of mine, Marco Rubio to the United States Senate. And you are going to re-elect Ron DeSantis as your governor,” Trump said. The Republican rally for JD Vance has begun in Dayton, Ohio, and Republican candidate for the House of Representatives JR Majewski has taken the stage expressing hope that Trump will announce his bid for reelection. “Folks I can’t wait to see Trump Force One come on down the tarmac and I hope we hear the announcement that we’ve been waiting for: Trump 2024.” Majewski, who started his speech by saying his pronouns were “patriot” and “ass kicker” also called Nancy Pelosi “drunk” and “nasty” and “dared” Democrat candidate for Ohio senate Tim Ryan to come to the rally. “Timmy if you’re watching, and I know you are, there’s a whole lot of Maga going on in Dayton, Ohio, and you should come on down here, I double-dog dare you.” In another DNC virtual reception on Monday afternoon, President Joe Biden said the Democrats were “up against some of the darkest forces we’ve ever seen in our history”, according to a White House Pool report from the Guardian’s David Smith. “These Maga Republicans are a different breed of cat. This is not your father’s Republican party.” Biden reiterated his gratitude for the DNC’s work ahead of the midterm elections and said he thought they had a shot at keeping the Senate and that he was “optimistic about the House as well”. “It’s not about power for power’s sake,” Biden said. “It’s about getting power to work for people who need a little bit of help. Just a shot.” “Again, not power for power’s sake but power for the good of the country. I know it’s not easy,” he continued. Biden’s remarks come hours before Donald Trump is expected to announce his bid for reelection at a rally for Senate candidate JD Vance in Ohio. There are dozens of lawsuits being filed ahead of the election in battleground states, CNN is reporting. Many of the 120 lawsuits filed since 3 November deal with voting processes like how people can vote and how votes are counted. It’s a major increase from previous elections, according to the CNN report which indicates there were only 68 pre-election lawsuits in 2020. One in five of these complaints were filed by state GOP committees or the Republican National Committee. A judge in Detroit threw out one such lawsuit earlier today, according to the Associated Press. The lawsuit brought by Kristin Karamo, the GOP candidate for secretary of state, challenged voting by absentee ballot and intended to force Michigan residents to vote in person. But the judge found that there was no evidence of election violations, despite the plaintiffs’ arguments. Johana Bhuiyan here taking over the blog. Today, President Joe Biden spoke at a virtual Democratic National Committee reception and said he was optimistic about tomorrow’s elections and thanked those in attendance for their hard work. He also warned that they still had a “lot of work to do to get out that vote”, according to a pool report. “You helped get me and Kamala elected in 2020 and we’re going to surprise the living devil out of people because of all the work you’ve done,” Biden said. Biden also said that if “Maga Republicans take over” American jobs, ingenuity, as well as fundamental rights and freedoms are “very much in jeopardy”. “I want to remind you to remind your teams, with so much at stake for our nation, don’t leave a thing – put it all out there,” he said. “Go full bore till the last poll closes. Make that extra call – not a joke. Knock on that extra door.” Hello again, live blog readers, it’s a lively day in US politics, on the eve of the midterm elections. We’ll continue to bring you the news as it happens for the next few hours. My colleague Johana Bhuiyan will take over now. Here’s where the day stands so far: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s first interview since the attack on her husband, Paul Pelosi, last month by a seemingly-unhinged, right-wing conspiracy theory-spouting assailant will be broadcast tonight by CNN at 8pm. Donald Trump has appealed a judge’s order to install a watchdog at the Trump Organization family business before a civil fraud case by the state’s attorney general goes to trial. Rumors are swirling that Trump could announce his 2024 presidential bid tonight when he appears at a rally for Senate candidate JD Vance in Dayton, Ohio, on the eve of the midterm elections, where Republicans hope to shine. Twitter owner Elon Musk posted on his social media platform endorsing the Republicans in the midterm elections.

It’s the last full day of election campaigning before the big vote tomorrow. US president Joe Biden and former president and Republican beacon Donald Trump will be out on the trail tonight in a contest where so much is at stake for each of their parties – and American democracy. Yet more speculation that Donald Trump could announce his next run for president, in the 2024 race, tonight at a rally he’s attending in Ohio for Republican candidate for the US Senate there, JD Vance. Now the New York Post has a report. Note the ever-teasing, ever-shifting nature of the situation. The tabloid notes, citing anonymous sources, that Trump “has told several allies he could announce a 2024 presidential run Monday night” – bold italics ours. The article further mentions, again our bolding and italicizing: “A well-connected Republican source said the 45th president was ‘telling people he might tonight, but it’s not a done thing’.” The Post acknowledges it’s not clear what will happen, and that Trump is “mercurial.” A judge today agreed to extend the deadline to return absentee ballots for voters in a suburban Atlanta county who didn’t receive their ballots because election officials failed to mail them. Some of the voters filed a lawsuit Sunday seeking the extension after Cobb county election officials in Cobb county acknowledged Friday that the county failed to mail out more than 1,000 absentee ballots to voters who had requested them, The Associated Press reports. County elections director Janine Eveler wrote in an email to the county election board that because of staff error, ballots were never created nor sent on two days last month, the lawsuit says. We know it wasn’t the voters’ fault, we know it wasn’t the post office’s fault. This was an administrative error,” said Daniel White, an attorney for the elections office, according to The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. As a result of the error, 1,036 voters never received the ballots they requested. State election data shows that about 250 of them had voted in person during early voting. But the lawsuit said many of those whose ballots weren’t sent may not be able to vote without action by the court. Election officials agreed to the lawsuit’s demands that the deadline to return ballots be extended and that the voters be contacted and sent an absentee ballot by overnight mail. During the three weeks of early voting that precede Election Day, election officials are supposed to send out ballots within three days of receiving a request. Voters then have until 7 p.m. on Election Day to return their ballots. Georgia is a battleground state that features a fiercely contested governor’s race, as well as a Senate contest between Democratic Senator Raphael Warnock and Republican Herschel Walker that could determine which party controls the narrowly divided chamber. Here’s the Guardian’s latest Politics Weekly America podcast, where host Jonathan Freedland reports from Georgia. For Raphael Warnock, a boost from Stevie Wonder can’t hurt. The newest US Supreme Court justice Ketanji Brown Jackson has issued her first supreme court opinion, making a short dissent today in support of a death row inmate from Ohio. Jackson wrote that she would have thrown out lower court rulings in the case of inmate Davel Chinn, whose lawyers argued that the state suppressed evidence that might have altered the outcome of his trial, The Associated Press reports. Jackson, in a two-page opinion, wrote that she would have ordered a new look at Chinn’s case: Because his life is on the line and given the substantial likelihood that the suppressed records would have changed the outcome at trial.” The evidence at issue indicated that a key witness against Chinn has an intellectual disability that might have affected his memory and ability to testify accurately, she wrote. Prosecutors are required to turn over potentially exculpatory evidence to the defense. In this case, lower courts determined that the outcome would not have been affected if the witness’ records had been provided to Chinn’s lawyers. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was the only other member of the court to join Jackson’s opinion. The two justices also were allies in dissent Monday in Sotomayor’s opinion that there was serious prosecutorial misconduct in the trial of a Louisiana man who was convicted of sex trafficking. Jackson joined the high court on June 30, following the retirement of Justice Stephen Breyer, her onetime boss. The court has yet to decide any of the cases argued in October or the first few days of this month. Jackson almost certainly will be writing a majority opinion in one of those cases. There’s a fuller report from The Hill, which has this quote: Justices Jackson and Sotomayor recognized the injustice in upholding Davel Chinn’s conviction and death sentence when the State suppressed exculpatory evidence that, based on the Ohio Courts’ own representations, was likely to result in an acquittal. Ohio must not exacerbate the mistakes of the past by pursuing Mr. Chinn’s execution,” said Rachel Troutman, an attorney for Chinn. Results in the midterm elections will come through in dribs and drabs after polls close at various times tomorrow and races could be called in hours, a few days or more. Here’s a useful piece from FiveThirtyEight with a guide to the races state by state. We probably won’t know who the winners are on election night itself, and therefore who will have control of the House and Senate next year. For example, in the crucial race in Pennsylvania for an open US Senate seat, things could take a while. Why the midterms matter, by our Guardian team: The Guardian relies on the Associated Press to declare when races have been called. US support for Ukraine’s continued resistance to the invasion by Russia will be “unflinching and unwavering,” the White House has asserted. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is briefing the media in Washington right now and has been asked about support for Ukraine, given a lot of reporting that if the Republicans win control of one or both chambers of Congress in the midterm elections they will block further spending on military aid for Ukraine. Jean-Pierre said that the White House will work hard to make sure there is a bipartisan effort on Ukraine, no matter the results of the midterm elections. Those voters who have not already cast their ballots are invited to go to the polls tomorrow, on election day. Meanwhile, Jean-Pierre reported that no specific, credible threats to the security of the midterm elections have been reported by law enforcement, Reuters adds. “Law enforcement has briefed us that there are no specific, credible threats identified at this point,” Jean-Pierre told the briefing. Biden has been briefed “on the threat environment and directed that all appropriate steps be taken to ensure safe and secure voting,” she said. Further on Ukraine: House speaker Nancy Pelosi was asleep in her residence in Washington when the doorbell rang at 5am on Friday morning last month, followed by banging on the door, CNN reports. “So I run to the door, and I’m very scared,” Pelosi has told Anderson Cooper in an exclusive interview to be aired on CNN tonight. She added: “I see the Capitol police and they say, ‘We have to come in to talk to you.’ And I’m thinking my children, my grandchildren. I never thought it would be Paul because, you know, I knew he wouldn’t be out and about, shall we say. And so they came in. At that time, we didn’t even know where he was,” she said. Paul Pelosi had been attacked in the couple’s San Francisco home, an assailant, demanding to see Nancy, whacking him on the head with a hammer, breaking his skull and putting him in hospital. The attack heightened fears of further escalation in threats of violence to lawmakers, families and staff. Former US president Donald Trump today appealed a judge’s order to install a watchdog at the Trump Organization family business before a civil fraud case by the state’s attorney general goes to trial. Manhattan-based judge Arthur Engoron last Thursday granted state attorney general Letitia James’s request to appoint an independent monitor to halt alleged ongoing fraud at the real estate company and keep the Trumps from transferring assets out of her reach, Reuters reports. Engoron’s order bars the defendants from transferring assets without court approval, and requires that the monitor receive a “full and accurate description” of the Trump Organization’s structure and assets. James had in September named Trump, three of his adult children, the Trump Organization and others as defendants in a $250m civil fraud lawsuit for allegedly overvaluing assets and Trump’s net worth through a decade of lies to banks and insurers. In a notice of appeal filed today, Trump’s lawyer Alina Habba and lawyers for his children, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump, and Donald Trump Jr, said the defendants asked the appellate division, a mid-level state appeals court, to review Engoron’s order, without laying out her legal arguments. Trump, a Republican, last week called Engoron’s order “ridiculous” and the Trump Organization called it an “obvious attempt” to influence Tuesday’s midterm US elections. James is a Democrat. Engoron gave both sides until 10 November to recommend three candidates to be come a monitor. The case is among many legal battles Trump faces as he mulls a 2024 bid for the presidency. Testimony began last week in another Manhattan courtroom in a criminal case by the Manhattan district attorney’s office accusing the Trump Organization of scheming to defraud tax authorities for at least 15 years. The company has pleaded not guilty. James has accused Trump et al of “staggering fraud”. A Michigan judge harshly rebuked Kristina Karamo, the Republican nominee to be Michigan’s top election official, as he rejected a last-minute lawsuit to get tens of thousands of mail-in ballots rejected. Karamo’s campaign filed a last minute challenge seeking to invalidate mail-in ballots in Detroit, which is heavily Black and Democratic, saying the city’s process for validating the mail-in votes ran afoul of state law. A ruling in her favor could have invalidated the votes of 60,000 people who voted by mail already in the city. But Timothy Kenny, the chief judge for the third judicial circuit, rejected that request on Monday, saying the challengers had not produced any evidence of illegal activity. “Plaintiffs have raised a false flag of election law violations and corruption concerning Detroit’s procedures for the November 8th election. This Court’s ruling takes down that flag,” Kenny wrote in his ruling. “Plaintiffs’ failure to produce any evidence that the procedures for this November 8th election violate state or federal election law demonizes the Detroit City Clerk, her office staff, and the 1,200 volunteers working this election. These claims are unjustified, devoid of any evidentiary basis and cannot be allowed to stand,” he added. I’ve been reporting in Michigan these last few days and yesterday afternoon I caught up with Jocelyn Benson, a Democrat who is running for re-election as secretary of state. She’s also overseeing the election here, a key battleground state, where there are concerns about violence and intimidation at the polls. Benson is one of several Democrats across the country who are running against opponents who have cast doubt on the 2020 election results. Her opponent, Kristina Karamo, has falsely claimed she witnessed fraud on election night in 2020 and recently filed a lawsuit trying to get thousands of mail-in ballots in Detroit rejected. Benson told me she saw the suit as an effort to pre-emptively cast doubt on the election results in Detroit. “This is certainly a strategic effort to sow seeds of doubt about the integrity of our elections, about the validity of absentee ballots in Detroit. There’s no question that’s the strategy there. I don’t think it’s worked,” she said. “What we’ve seen in response, and in part that’s because of the work we’ve done over the last few years to call out the election deniers and lies and the meritless lawsuits as they’ve been filed, is that there’s almost a uniform chorus, particularly coming from Detroit, acknowledging the invalidity of the lawsuit, acknowledging the real nefarious intent behind it, she added. “I think it’s backfired.” I also asked Benson, who is leading in the polls, what strategies other candidates running against election deniers could take away from her campaign. “Talking in the abstract about democracy being under attack, while that’s real and I’ve certainly done that over the last few years and will continue to do so, we really also need to talk in the specifics about what that actually means,” she said. “What it means to empower folks who have been lying to voters as opposed to holding them accountable and rejecting them.” Here’s something else from Levine and team: Benson was getting some celeb support this weekend, as was governor Whitmer. Campaign trail madness. Richard Luscombe reports on the prospects of the Republican “ultra-Maga” candidates, the standard-bearers of Trumpism, in tomorrow’s elections … The spectre of Donald Trump’s imminent declaration of a new White House run looms over races in several key states ahead of Tuesday’s US midterm elections, with the former president poised to seize on any success for ultra-conservative candidates as validation for his 2024 campaign. Opinion polls appearing to reflect a last-minute surge of support for Trump-endorsed nominees in a number of crucial congressional and governors’ contests came as the former president appeared at a rally for the Republican senator Marco Rubio in Florida on Sunday. Heaping praise on “an incredible slate of true Maga warriors”, Trump cited his “Make America Great Again” political slogan. Full article: The former US ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina governor Nikki Haley told Republicans at a rally for Herschel Walker the Democrat in the Georgia Senate race, Rev Raphael Warnock, should be “deported”. “Legal immigrants are more patriotic than the leftists these days,” Haley said, in Hiram, Georgia on Sunday. “They worked to come into America and they love America. They want the laws followed in America. So the only person we need to make sure we deport is Warnock.” Haley, widely thought to be a potential candidate for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024, is the child of immigrants from India. Her comment drew criticism. Cornell William Brooks, a Harvard professor and pastor, wrote: “Were it not for civil rights laws Black folks died for, Nikki Haley’s family might not be in America. “Were it not for a HBCU [historically Black college and university] giving her father his first job in the US, Haley wouldn’t be in a position to insult Georgia’s first Black senator. Warnock’s history makes her story possible.” Walker and Warnock are locked in a tight race that could decide control of the US Senate, currently split 50-50 and controlled with the vote of the vice-president, Kamala Harris. On Monday, the polling website FiveThirtyEight.com put Warnock one point ahead. Haley also said Walker was “a good person who has been put through the ringer and has had everything but the kitchen sink thrown at him”. Walker, a former college and NFL football star, has been shown to have made numerous false claims about his business career and personal life. Two women have said he pressured them to have abortions – allegations he denies, while campaigning on a stringently anti-abortion platform. Here’s more about Walker: Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the violent, rightwing militia-style organization the Oath Keepers, told jurors on Monday there was no plan for his band of extremists to attack the US Capitol on January 6, 2021 – as he tries to clear his name in his seditious conspiracy trial. Taking the stand in his defense for a second day, Rhodes testified that he had no idea that his followers were going to join the pro-Trump mob to storm the Capitol and that he was upset after he found out that some did, The Associated Press writes. Rhodes said he believed it was stupid for any Oath Keepers to go into the Capitol. He insisted that was not their “mission.” There was no plan to enter the building for any purpose,” Rhodes told the court in Washington, DC. Rhodes is on trial with four others for what prosecutors have alleged was a plan to stage an armed rebellion to stop the transfer of presidential power from Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Joe Biden. Prosecutors have tried to show that for the Oath Keepers, the riot was not a spur-of-the-moment protest but part of a serious, weeks-long plot. Rhodes’ defense is focused largely on the idea that his rhetoric was aimed at convincing Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act, which gives the president wide discretion to decide when military force is necessary and what qualifies as military force. Rhodes told jurors he believed it would have been legal for Trump to invoke that act and call up a militia in response to what he believed was an “unconstitutional” and “invalid” election. When prosecutors get a chance to question Rhodes this week, they are likely to highlight messages such as one Rhodes sent in December 2020 in which he said Trump “needs to know that if he fails to act, then we will.” Rhodes did not go into the Capitol during the insurrection on January 6 last year. Prosecutors have spent weeks methodically laying out evidence that shows Rhodes and the Oath Keepers discussing the prospect of violence before January 6 and the need to keep Biden out of the White House at all costs. Rhodes denies the charges against him. Also In the realm of ‘it’s the economy, stupid’, here’s what Joe Biden is tweeting this morning. And if you can vote but don’t you surely can’t complain about the outcome of the elections tomorrow. Here’s what US vice president Kamala Harris and second gentleman Doug Emhoff have on their minds today: Here’s Guardian superstar columnist, professor, author and former labor secretary Robert Reich. American democracy itself is in effect on the ballot at tomorrow’s elections There are forces from the right-wing seeking to bring victories for Republican candidates running for office at national and state level who are threatening democracy in ways ranging from claiming that Joe Biden did not win the 2020 presidential election to planning more voter suppression and challenges to voting systems in numerous states. Democratic House majority whip James Clyburn issued a dire warning via Fox News yesterday. Clyburn swung vital, southern, Black voter support behind Joe Biden in 2020 to help him come from far behind to clinch the Democratic nomination for president. Here’s a recent Guardian special report on the threat to US elections. In a round-up of predictions from some other outlets’ reporters whose job it is to be 24/7 election obsessives for the specialist websites, Politico summarizes some of the forecasts for the House. The Cook Political Report’s House of Representatives specialist David Wasserman assesses today that 212 seats House seats can be called “lean Republican” or stronger for the GOP and 188 seats are leaning towards the Democrats, and there are 35 seats he deems to be toss-ups. Wasserman tells Politico that if those toss-ups were to split evenly, Republicans would wind up at around 230 seats, a gain of 17. His team believes a Republican gain of 15 to 25 seats in the House is most likely but also that toss-ups could break mostly one way or the other and if they break red, that will of course push GOP gains even higher. Kyle Kondik’s House forecast for online political newsletter and election handicapper Sabato’s Crystal Ball, reckons the GOP will gain 24 seats in the House. They only need to flip five seats from the current balance to give them control of the chamber and block further Biden legislation, no matter what happens in the US Senate. And opinion-poll analysis specialists FiveThirtyEight give Republicans an 80% chance of winning between one and 33 seats in the House. Here’s an explainer from some of the Guardian US team about why the midterms matter. Could Trump announce his 2024 bid tonight? That is certainly the rumor flying around senior Republican circles at the moment, according to Axios scribe Jonathan Swan. The well-regarded journalist has tweeted that a flood of Republican figures are in various stages of panic and anticipation that Donald Trump will use the platform of his Ohio rally tonight to announce a 2024 run. Of course, the truth is probably unknowable – perhaps even to Trump himself given his proclivity to do things on the fly. What is certain is that all the speculation on a Trump White House run is firmly centered on when not if. Republicans are going to revel in a so-called red wave in the US midterm elections, winning control of both chambers of Congress and putting Democrat Joe Biden’s back right up against the wall for the rest of this presidential term, if the predictions of Henry Olsen, Washington Post columnist and senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, are anything to go by. He is certainly at the high end of super-geek predictions in his forecast for the shellacking awaiting Democrats. He’s predicting that the GOP will gain 33 House seats and also take a 54-46 Senate majority once voting ends tomorrow evening. Politico, by contrast, is predicting a modest win for Republicans and keeps the Senate competition as a toss-up, with one last full day on the campaign trail remaining. About 41 million Americans have already voted in a surge of early voting, out of almost 170 million registered voters in the country. Here’s Olsen’s piece in the WaPo today. Volker Türk, the new United Nations high commissioner for human rights, yesterday urged Twitter owner Elon Musk to make respect for human rights central to the social media platform, amid savage cuts to the tech company’s staff under its new chief. In an open letter, Türk said that reports of the new owner laying off the platform’s entire human rights team were “not, from my perspective, an encouraging start”. Türk said he was writing with “concern and apprehension about our digital public square and Twitter’s role in it”. He also warned against propagating hate speech and misinformation and highlighted the need to protect user privacy, saying free speech was “not a free pass”. Since his $44bn takeover, Musk has dissolved the company’s board, sacked its CEO, Parag Agrawal, along with senior managers, and began mass layoffs last Friday. Türk, who posted the open letter on Twitter, where he has more than 25,000 followers, wrote: “Like all companies, Twitter needs to understand the harms associated with its platform and take steps to address them. “Respect for our shared human rights should set the guardrails for the platform’s use and evolution. In short, I urge you to ensure human rights are central to the management of Twitter under your leadership.” You can read the full story here. Twitter owner Elon Musk today made the controversial decision to endorse the Republicans in the crucial midterm elections being held tomorrow, and post that on his platform. But the mass layoffs at Twitter last week that diminished several teams, including staff on the company’s safety and misinformation teams, had already attracted warnings that the actions could spell disaster during the elections, the Guardian’s Kari Paul has reported. The company has laid off around 50% of its workforce, according to news reports; a figure that Musk and others have not disputed, amounting to an estimated 3,700 people. The internal chaos unfolding at Twitter, in addition to a sudden lack of staff and resources dedicated to counteracting misinformation, has created ideal conditions for election misinformation to thrive, said Paul Barrett, an expert in disinformation and fake news at New York University. “Twitter is in the midst of a category 5 hurricane, and that is not a good environment for fostering vigilance when dealing with inevitable attempts to spread falsehoods and hateful content on a very influential platform,” he said. This while Musk and other senior figures have sought to re-assure the public. Musk posted this silly tweet last night: Here’s his current pinned tweet, from last Friday: Here’s some Guardian reading. Elon Musk has just posted on Twitter, the social media platform he now owns, endorsing the Republicans in the US midterm elections. Musk is the entrepreneur behind Tesla electric cars, SpaceX rockets and now Twitter, the social media platform so beloved of politicos and journalists. He further noted: ‘Republicans have a grip on the House majority. But the Senate is firmly up for grabs’ That’s the inside view of the election-watching reporters at politics-specialist news website Politico today. The outlet writes: The first midterm election is historically a bear for the president’s party, and this year is expected to be no different. Republicans are likely to gain upward of 15 House seats, and they have a good shot of taking full control of Congress. But in many of the most consequential statewide races, Democrats are still in the hunt – thanks to their candidates’ strong fundraising and polls that show, for now, they are running ahead of President Joe Biden’s poor approval ratings. Whether that holds up – if Democratic senator Mark Kelly can outpace Arizona voters’ opinions of Biden by the margin pre-election polls suggest, for example – will determine whether Democrats can retain control of the Senate and limit their losses in the House. Meanwhile, the party is also defending nearly a dozen governorships Republicans are targeting. A good election for Republicans could see them reaching deep into blue territory to oust Democratic governors in states like Oregon and New York. But Democrats have a chance to keep many of their vulnerable states if they even slightly overperform expectations. We put a lot of focus on our live blogs, bringing you news developments and snippets of analysis on various things as they happen, whether politics, breaking news or big events, as our regular readers know. This US politics blog will begin early tomorrow for election day and roll around the clock into Wednesday, thanks to our blogging reporters in Washington, New York, Los Angeles and London, backed by our whole team, including reporters out in the field watching voting and election night events coast to coast and sending dispatches. But in other major rolling news coverage, we are now also blogging the vital Cop27 climate talks taking place in Egypt, which got underway yesterday. America’s Al Gore earlier called out world leaders for not doing enough, treating the environment like an open sewer and enabling a “culture of death” with over-reliance on fossil fuels in the face of climate instability revving extreme weather. And the UN chief is warning the world it’s on the “highway to climate hell.” You can follow the Guardian’s live blog on Cop27 issues and happenings here. Cop27 runs through November 18. Joe Biden arrives at the summit on Friday. Meanwhile, we’re also blogging Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukraine’s efforts could be affected if Republicans do too well in the midterm elections in the US and block funding for US weapons to Ukraine to resist its gigantic neighbor. The head of the so-called Wagner Russian mercenary group has also admitted persistent allegations of interference in US elections. But in terms of the war, we’ve been live blogging the conflict since Russia invaded in February and you can follow war news as it happens, here. We also run a business live blog and a UK politics live blog, both reported out of the Guardian mother ship in London. Joe Biden is fighting a rearguard action to stave off defeat in Tuesday’s midterm elections as Republicans look poised to make sweeping gains in the US Congress, setting up two years of political trench warfare. The president, along with former president Barack Obama, has been crisscrossing America in a last-ditch bid to persuade voters that a Democratic victory is critical not only to Biden’s legislative agenda but the preservation of American democracy. But momentum appears to be with Republicans capitalising on frustration over inflation and fears of crime and illegal immigration. Election forecasters and polls say it is highly likely that the party of ex-president Donald Trump will win a majority in the House of Representatives and also have a shot of taking control of the Senate. “Republicans are peaking at the right time,” said Brendan Buck, a former aide to Republican House speakers Paul Ryan and John Boehner. “Democrats did a good job defying political gravity for a long time but it’s finally catching up to them. It feels like a healthy Republican majority in the House and, if I were a betting man, I would guess that Republicans pick up the one Senate seat that they need.” Midterms are held every four years but in 2022 they are far from routine and have seen a huge increase in early voting turnout. Tuesday’s election represents the first nationwide test of democracy since Trump’s followers staged a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 last year. A surprise Democratic victory in the House and Senate would give Biden a mandate to pursue a sweeping legislative agenda on issues such as abortion rights, police reform and voting rights during his two remaining years in the Oval Office. But Republican control of either chamber would be enough to derail such ambitions and raise questions over the US’s open-ended support for Ukraine’s war against Russia. Full report here. Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin said today he had interfered in US elections and would continue doing so in future, the first such admission from a figure who has been formally implicated by Washington in efforts to influence American politics, Reuters writes. In comments posted by the press service of his Concord catering firm on Russia’s Facebook equivalent VKontakte, Prigozhin said: We have interfered (in US elections), we are interfering and we will continue to interfere. Carefully, accurately, surgically and in our own way, as we know how to do. The remark was posted on the eve of the US midterm elections in response to a request for comment from a Russian news site. During our pinpoint operations, we will remove both kidneys and the liver at once,” Prigozhin said. He did not elaborate on the cryptic comment. Prigozhin, who is often referred to as “Putin’s chef” because his catering company operates Kremlin contracts, has been formally accused of sponsoring Russia-based “troll farms” that seek to influence US politics. In July, the US state department offered a reward of up to $10m for information on Prigozhin in connection with “engagement in US election interference”. He has been hit by US, British and European Union sanctions. Prigozhin kept a low public profile until recently but has become more outspoken in the course of the Ukraine war, including by criticising the performance of Russia’s generals. In September he admitted to founding the Kremlin-aligned Wagner Group mercenary group, which is active in Syria, Africa and Ukraine. We’ll have more on this from Guardian reporters later. It’s the last full day of election campaigning before the big vote tomorrow. US president Joe Biden and former president and Republican beacon Donald Trump will be out on the trail in a contest where so much is at stake for each of their parties – and American democracy. It’s a tough battle for the Democrats against strong economic headwinds in the shape of record inflation and fears of recession, despite the fact that such gales are howling across many other countries as well, driven by ongoing fall-out from the pandemic and the effects of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The party has been struggling against their president’s low approval ratings for more than a year now – though it hopes the shock of the US Supreme Court stripping federal abortion rights when it overturned Roe v Wade in June and the threat of extremism from the right will boost their chances. Republicans hope not only to pick up the traditional midterms backlash against the party in power but to power a “red wave” and win big, wresting the majority in both the House and Senate from the Democrats. Biden is rallying in the governor’s race in Maryland tonight and Trump is stumping in Ohio, where Democratic congressman Tim Ryan is battling JD Vance. Biden’s warning of what will happen to the US economy if Republicans ever get a chance to wreck the healthcare and retirement benefits backbone. We’ll have a Guardian reporter at each event tonight, in Bowie, Maryland, and Dayton, Ohio. All 435 seats in the House of Representatives are on the line, 35 out of 100 Senate seats are being contested in these midterms election. It’s not exactly clear who will pursue the Republican nomination for president in 2024, but now we know someone who will not be: Tom Cotton, the US senator from Arkansas. Cotton on Monday told the Republican-friendly Fox News network that he will not seek the Oval Office in two years because it was “not the right time” for his family. His remarks confirmed a Politico report late Sunday that, citing anonymous sources, said Cotton would not enter a field of GOP presidential nominees that could include former president Donald Trump and Florida’s governor Ron DeSantis. “Family was really the only consideration,” Cotton, who has a wife and two children, said to Fox. “This is not the right time for our family for me to commit to a six-to-seven day a week campaign for the next two years.” The 45-year-old Cotton is a former soldier who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Arlington Cemetery before entering politics as a foreign policy hawk. He’s been a senator for Arkansas since 2015, and his current term doesn’t expire until 2027. Cotton voted to acquit Trump both times the former president was impeached, the second time for inciting the US Capitol attack on January 6 2021. The senator published a book on 31 October, Only the Strong: Reversing the Left’s Plot to Sabotage American Power, in which he bragged about refusing to pay attention to Trump’s first impeachment trial before voting to acquit him. The book also criticizes the White Houses helmed by Democrats Joe Biden and Barack Obama. Good morning, US politics live blog readers, it’s midterms Monday, the last campaign day before those who haven’t already voted go to the polls tomorrow in an election that’s a crucial taking of America’s political temperature this November. It will be a busy day, here’s some of what’s coming up: Joe Biden and Donald Trump both plan to be back on the stump today after a frantic weekend of campaigning, where the US president turned out with his Democratic predecessor and former boss, Barack Obama, and Trump, the ex, one-term Republican US president, showed he is still the most powerful force in his party. Biden campaigned in super-swing, super-crucial Pennsylvania at the weekend but tonight is playing safer and closer to home with an appearance in Maryland for gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore, who appears to have a decent chance of making history as that state’s first Black governor. Trump stump: the Donald will be back in Ohio tonight, in Dayton, to rally in a state that has rallied around him. The stakes are very high in a race for an open seat in the US Senate, with rightwing author and Trump convert JD Vance trying to secure the win over congressman and ex-presidential candidate Tim Ryan. More than 40 million Americans have already cast their ballots in early voting. There are almost 170 million registered voters in the US and a big turnout is expected in on-day voting tomorrow. Results may take a while to come in because of so many different rules across different states. The Democrats are fighting to keep control of the House of Representatives (though analysts expect them to lose), where all 435 seats are being contested and the US Senate (analysts say “toss-up”), where 35 out of the 100 seats are in contention, against a backdrop of high inflation. The effectiveness of the remainder of Joe Biden’s first term, and probably the health of Democrats’ prospects of holding onto the White House in 2024, are on the line, as well as many aspects of the embattled US democratic machine.","charCount":"45870","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/johana-bhuiyan\">Johana Bhuiyan</a> (now) and <a href=\"profile/joannawalters\">Joanna Walters</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"us-news/2022/nov/07/trump-desantis-republican-party-analysis","type":"article","sectionId":"us-news","sectionName":"US news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T20:45:52Z","webTitle":"Expect the Trump-DeSantis animosity to evolve into open warfare after midterms","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/07/trump-desantis-republican-party-analysis","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/us-news/2022/nov/07/trump-desantis-republican-party-analysis","fields":{"headline":"Expect the Trump-DeSantis animosity to evolve into open warfare after midterms","standfirst":"<p>Polls show DeSantis positioned to win re-election on Tuesday but political opponents say his focus is locked on a White House run</p>","trailText":"Analysis: Polls show DeSantis positioned to win re-election on Tuesday but political opponents say his focus is locked on a White House run","byline":"Richard Luscombe","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"f8340edcbc0c21ab5a769b3d5f0233e796acaf2e\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/f8340edcbc0c21ab5a769b3d5f0233e796acaf2e/0_72_2224_1335/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Ron DeSantis speaks in Sun City Center, Florida, on 6 November. \" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Ron DeSantis speaks in Sun City Center, Florida, on 6 November. </span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Octavio Jones/Getty Images</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The simmering animosity between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, the Florida governor emerging as Trump’s most likely challenger for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination, looks set to evolve into open warfare following the midterm elections.</p> <aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/07/midterms-2022-biden-democrats-republicans-trump\">‘A new political hellscape’: sweeping gains for Republicans could stifle Biden’s presidency</a> </p> </aside>  <p>Polls show DeSantis <a href=\"https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/governor/2022/florida/\">comfortably positioned</a> to win re-election on Tuesday but political opponents say his focus is locked on the national stage and a White House run.</p> <p>The two Republicans’ feuding became evident during a rally for Senate candidate Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania on Saturday, when Trump, who is expected to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/nov/06/trump-2024-presidential-run-announcement\">announce his presidential campaign imminently</a>, introduced his new nickname for the rising conservative star: Ron DeSanctimonious.</p> <p>It is a <a href=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/crooked-hillary-marco-donald-trumps-nicknames/story?id=39035114\">tactic that has cowed previous pretenders</a> to Trump’s crown as the Republican leader and kingmaker.

In response, Trump called DeSantis “<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/01/12/politics/trump-desantis-covid-boosters/index.html\">gutless</a>” for refusing to reveal if he had been given a Covid booster vaccine.</p> <p>In June, Trump began readying his anti-DeSantis rhetoric, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2022/jun/21/trump-desantis-2024-president-win\">telling the New Yorker</a> he would beat his rival in a nomination contest and claiming it was only his endorsement that revived the three-term congressman’s faltering campaign for governor in 2017.</p> <p>Now, with the distraction of the midterms almost out of the way, and with Trump seeking a clear run for his third presidential run as a Republican, DeSantis too has been granted a derogatory nickname.</p> <p>DeSantis’s apparent focus on 2024 – notwithstanding reports he has told donors he may wait until 2028, when Trump will be out of the way – became an issue during the governor’s debate in Florida last month.

Polls show DeSantis comfortably positioned to win re-election on Tuesday but political opponents say his focus is locked on the national stage and a White House run. The two Republicans’ feuding became evident during a rally for Senate candidate Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania on Saturday, when Trump, who is expected to announce his presidential campaign imminently, introduced his new nickname for the rising conservative star: Ron DeSanctimonious. It is a tactic that has cowed previous pretenders to Trump’s crown as the Republican leader and kingmaker.

But clues to their fractured relationship were evident as early as August 2020, when the notoriously prickly DeSantis denounced as “a phony narrative” an assertion he was the then-president’s “yes man” in Florida. The governor subsequently criticized Trump’s handling of the Covid-19 pandemic, saying earlier this year he regretted “not speaking out” sooner against Trump’s call for a nationwide lockdown. In response, Trump called DeSantis “gutless” for refusing to reveal if he had been given a Covid booster vaccine. In June, Trump began readying his anti-DeSantis rhetoric, telling the New Yorker he would beat his rival in a nomination contest and claiming it was only his endorsement that revived the three-term congressman’s faltering campaign for governor in 2017. Now, with the distraction of the midterms almost out of the way, and with Trump seeking a clear run for his third presidential run as a Republican, DeSantis too has been granted a derogatory nickname. DeSantis’s apparent focus on 2024 – notwithstanding reports he has told donors he may wait until 2028, when Trump will be out of the way – became an issue during the governor’s debate in Florida last month. Charlie Crist, the Democratic nominee, repeatedly challenged DeSantis to say if he would commit to a full four-year term if re-elected. Seizing on DeSantis’s refusal to answer, Crist said: “It’s not a tough question. It’s a fair question. He won’t tell you.” DeSantis described Crist, a Republican Florida governor turned Democratic congressman, “a worn out old donkey” he was looking to “put out to pasture”. At the Miami rally on Sunday, Trump declined to criticize DeSantis again but offered only tepid support for him in Tuesday’s elections, compared to his comments about Rubio and other Republicans in congressional and state races. “You’re going to re-elect the wonderful, the great friend of mine, Marco Rubio to the United States Senate. And you are going to re-elect Ron DeSantis as your governor,” Trump said. Despite Trump’s attacks, DeSantis remains in a strong position, winning straw polls of grassroots supporters and becoming ever more visible on the national stage. According to Politico, he also has the backing for any presidential run of the Republican mega-donor Ken Griffin, who donated more than $60m to the party’s candidates during the midterms. “I don’t know what he’s going to do. It’s a huge personal decision,” Griffin said. “He has a tremendous record as governor of Florida, and our country would be well-served by him as president.”","charCount":"4189","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/richardluscombe\">Richard Luscombe</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"society/2022/nov/07/lgb-alliance-provides-public-benefit-court-hears-in-case-brought-by-trans-group","type":"article","sectionId":"society","sectionName":"Society","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T19:43:29Z","webTitle":"LGB Alliance provides ‘public benefit’, court hears, in case brought by trans group ","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/society/2022/nov/07/lgb-alliance-provides-public-benefit-court-hears-in-case-brought-by-trans-group","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/society/2022/nov/07/lgb-alliance-provides-public-benefit-court-hears-in-case-brought-by-trans-group","fields":{"headline":"LGB Alliance provides ‘public benefit’, court hears, in case brought by trans group ","standfirst":"<p>Claim made in final arguments of action brought by Mermaids seeking removal of charitable status from LGB Alliance</p>","trailText":"Claim made in final arguments of action brought by Mermaids seeking removal of charitable status from LGB Alliance","byline":"Amelia Gentleman","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"e055ebb8496c56668182578f26bbc52cfc7e2fe3\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/e055ebb8496c56668182578f26bbc52cfc7e2fe3/0_238_6000_3600/1000.jpg\" alt=\"A Transgender Action Block protest against an LGB Alliance conference in Queen Elizabeth II Centre last month\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">A Transgender Action Block protest against an LGB Alliance conference in Queen Elizabeth II Centre last month.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Picture Capital/Alamy</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>The creation of LGB Alliance has promoted constructive debate on “difficult and problematic issues” of sex and gender, the Charity Commission told a court on Monday, during final arguments over whether the gay rights group should have been given charitable status.</p> <p>Iain Steele, counsel for the commission, said there was a public benefit inherent in having charities with different world views, encouraging debate in this “evolving” area of diversity and equality.</p> <p>Mermaids, which supports transgender, non-binary and gender diverse children and their families, launched an appeal last year against the Charity Commission’s grant of charitable status to LGB Alliance.

Iain Steele, counsel for the commission, said there was a public benefit inherent in having charities with different world views, encouraging debate in this “evolving” area of diversity and equality. Mermaids, which supports transgender, non-binary and gender diverse children and their families, launched an appeal last year against the Charity Commission’s grant of charitable status to LGB Alliance. Mermaids has argued that the group was set up to lobby the government to restrict legal rights afforded to transgender people. Summing up, Michael Gibbon KC, counsel for Mermaids, said LGB Alliance’s “worldview and objectives are based on conflict and confrontation. This makes its approach fundamentally unpleasant, aggressive and corrosive of public discourse.” He argued that LGB Alliance’s goals were “quintessentially political” and that the group was working to undermine and impede the work of charities like Mermaids “by promoting the view that they spread disinformation, and by seeking to deprive them of funding,” he said. The case has focused attention on the conflicting views of two organisations with very different interpretations of the relative importance of sex and gender. LGB Alliance stated in its application for charitable status that its position was that “there are only two sexes and gender is a social construct”. But Gibbon said the organisation was concealing its “true purpose”. “There is no single statement which sums up LGB Alliance’s views, but we say it is not limited to the abstract proposition that biological sex is immutable. They use such phrases as shorthand for more contentious views,” Gibbon said. He said LGB Alliance had repeatedly described Mermaids in derogatory terms, accusing the charity of promoting a “gender identity ideology”, of inappropriately medicalising children, “of child abuse, basically”, and of having homophobic views. The general regulatory chamber will have to rule whether the purpose of LGB Alliance is “exclusively charitable for the public benefit”. The tribunal has considered extensive new evidence about LGB Alliance, so is not reviewing the Charity Commission’s original decision, but will deliver a fresh judgment on whether it was appropriate to grant charitable status. Steele set out the law on the granting of charitable status, assessing whether or not the purposes of LGB Alliance were “exclusively charitable” and “for the public benefit”. “An institution whose purpose is to promote the rights and fair treatment of lesbian, gay and bisexual people will be acting for charitable purposes,” he said. “The issue is whether LGB Alliance was actually established to pursue the pro LGB purposes it set out or whether it really has anti trans purposes.” Noting Mermaids’ argument that LGB Alliance’s “true purpose” was different from its stated purpose, he stressed that it was unreasonable to expect the Charity Commission to look behind the stated purposes of an organisation, or to “trawl Twitter” for a hidden agenda.

Here is a roundup of the day’s main stories:</p> <ul> <li><p><strong>Ukraine has accused Russia of looting empty homes in the southern city of Kherson and occupying them with troops in civilian clothes to prepare for street fighting in what both sides predict will be one of the war’s most important battles. </strong>In recent days, Russia has ordered civilians out of Kherson in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city, the only regional capital Moscow has seized since its invasion in February.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kherson was cut off from water and electricity supplies on Sunday</strong> after an airstrike and damage to the Kakhovka dam, local officials said.</p></li> <li><p><strong>A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president has said Kyiv had never refused to negotiate with Moscow and that it was ready for talks with Russia’s future leader, but not with Vladimir Putin. </strong>The comments on Twitter by Mykhailo Podolyak followed a Washington Post report on Saturday saying the Biden administration was privately encouraging Ukraine’s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with Moscow.</p></li> <li><p><strong>The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said 50,000 Russian soldiers called up as part of his mobilisation drive were now fighting with combat units in <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a>, the Interfax news agency reported. </strong>Putin said 80,000 were “in the zone of the special military operation” - the term <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/russia\">Russia</a> uses for its war in Ukraine – and the rest of the almost 320,000 draftees were at training camps in Russia.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine’s military said</strong> <strong>Russia was urging</strong> <strong>residents of Kherson to evacuate as soon as possible, sending them warning messages on their phones</strong> <strong>on Sunday.</strong> Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, told state television. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson has already expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city.</p></li> <li><p>Serbia’s president, <strong>Aleksandar Vučić</strong>, has said he expects the battle of Kherson to be the defining battle of the war. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.”</p></li> <li><p><strong>Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said. </strong>It said the ministry had rejected the bloggers’ assertions that the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet had suffered “high, pointless losses in people and equipment”.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Ukraine continues to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/06/ukraine-motivational-messaging-maintains-morale-as-winter-bites\">brace for fresh Russian attacks</a> on its energy infrastructure</strong>. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said <strong>Volodymyr Zelenskiy</strong>, the Ukrainian president.</p></li> <li><p><strong>At least 88% of Ukrainians believe their country will be a prosperous member of the European Union in 10 years, according to a poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. </strong>Ukraine applied for membership of the EU shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February and Kyiv was granted candidate status in June.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Planned blackouts are scheduled to hit seven regions of <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/ukraine\">Ukraine</a> throughout Monday, according to Ukraine’s state-run energy company.</strong> The regions include the city of Kyiv, and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family.</strong> Vitali Klitschko urged residents to “consider everything”, including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.”</p></li> <li><p>Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, <strong>Vadym Prystaiko</strong>, echoed Klitschko’s words about evacuating Kyiv’s residents, saying: “I hope it won’t come to this.

Here is a roundup of the day’s main stories: Ukraine has accused Russia of looting empty homes in the southern city of Kherson and occupying them with troops in civilian clothes to prepare for street fighting in what both sides predict will be one of the war’s most important battles. In recent days, Russia has ordered civilians out of Kherson in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city, the only regional capital Moscow has seized since its invasion in February. Kherson was cut off from water and electricity supplies on Sunday after an airstrike and damage to the Kakhovka dam, local officials said. A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president has said Kyiv had never refused to negotiate with Moscow and that it was ready for talks with Russia’s future leader, but not with Vladimir Putin. The comments on Twitter by Mykhailo Podolyak followed a Washington Post report on Saturday saying the Biden administration was privately encouraging Ukraine’s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with Moscow. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said 50,000 Russian soldiers called up as part of his mobilisation drive were now fighting with combat units in Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported. Putin said 80,000 were “in the zone of the special military operation” - the term Russia uses for its war in Ukraine – and the rest of the almost 320,000 draftees were at training camps in Russia. Ukraine’s military said Russia was urging residents of Kherson to evacuate as soon as possible, sending them warning messages on their phones on Sunday. Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in, Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, told state television. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson has already expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, has said he expects the battle of Kherson to be the defining battle of the war. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.” Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said. It said the ministry had rejected the bloggers’ assertions that the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet had suffered “high, pointless losses in people and equipment”. Ukraine continues to brace for fresh Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. At least 88% of Ukrainians believe their country will be a prosperous member of the European Union in 10 years, according to a poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Ukraine applied for membership of the EU shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February and Kyiv was granted candidate status in June. Planned blackouts are scheduled to hit seven regions of Ukraine throughout Monday, according to Ukraine’s state-run energy company. The regions include the city of Kyiv, and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava. Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family. Vitali Klitschko urged residents to “consider everything”, including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, echoed Klitschko’s words about evacuating Kyiv’s residents, saying: “I hope it won’t come to this. If it comes to it, we’ll have to move them back to the west of Ukraine, Lviv and all the places closer to the European Union. That’s a huge number of people to be located but Ukrainian winters can become quite harsh. We have to think how we do it.” Maksym Kozytskyi, the governor of Lviv, one of Ukraine’s western-most regions, has announced preparation measures for receiving more refugees and internally displaced people into his region, and appealed for help with the provision of diesel generators and financial aid for medical supplies. Ukraine has received its first delivery of Nasams and Apside air defence systems, the country’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced on Monday. “We will continue to shoot down the enemy targets attacking us. Thank you to our partners: Norway, Spain and the US,” Reznikov wrote on Twitter. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported on Monday that President Vladimir Putin will make a decision on whether to attend the next G20 summit in person by the end of the week. Zelenskiy has said he will not attend if Putin does. The summit in Bali is due to begin on Tuesday 15 November. The head of Ukraine’s Byzantine-rite Catholic Church, Sviatoslav Shevchuk, met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Monday and said there can be no dialogue with Russia as long as Moscow considered the neighbour it invaded as a colony to be subjugated. The Orthodox church of Ukraine has said worshippers can celebrate Christmas on 25 December, a move away from the traditional date of 7 January directed against the pro-Putin head of the Russian Orthodox church. An internal rift over the supply of deadly drones to Russia for use in Ukraine has opened up in Iran, with a prominent conservative cleric and newspaper editor saying Russia is the clear aggressor in the war and the supply should stop. A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has told Sky News in London that the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the country soon. Sunak had promised that Ukraine would be his first overseas port of call if he became PM, but in a high-profile U-turn he has headed to Egypt and Cop27 instead. Prystaiko said:“We’re not going to discuss the dates, because of the security of your prime minister. But he’s coming to Ukraine quite soon.” Thanks for following along today. I’ll be back tomorrow but it’s goodbye for now. Firefighters work at the scene of a damaged residential building after Russian shelling in liberated Lyman, Donetsk region, earlier today. At least 88% of Ukrainians believe their country will be a prosperous member of the European Union in 10 years, according to a poll published by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. Ukraine applied for membership of the EU shortly after Russia launched a full-scale invasion in February and Kyiv was granted candidate status in June. The invasion has killed thousands of civilians and devastated vast tracts of territory and infrastructure, Reuters reported. The poll surveyed 1,000 respondents across Ukraine with the exception of the annexed peninsula of Crimea and other areas that were occupied by Russian proxies when Moscow launched its invasion. Ukrainians were optimistic about their chances of joining the EU even in the east of the country, which has experienced particularly heavy fighting, the poll found. Seventy-six percent of respondents there saw the future of their country in the EU. Only 5% said they believed the war would ultimately leave the country with a destroyed economy and provoke a large exodus of Ukrainians. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, has reportedly held talks with aides to Russia’s president, Vladimir Putin, with the aim of reducing the risk that the war in Ukraine could spill over or escalate into a nuclear conflict. The Wall Street Journal said the senior White House figure had held confidential conversations in recent months with the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and the Russian security council secretary, Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan’s counterpart, that were not made public. Neither Washington nor Moscow has confirmed if the talks took place and the report did not detail the times or dates of the phone calls. The Kremlin spokesperson, Dmitry Peskov, declined to comment on the report at his daily briefing. “Once again, I repeat that there are some truthful reports, but for the most part there are reports that are pure speculation,” he told reporters. At the National Opera of Ukraine in Kyiv recently, I watched a performance of an opera by the Ukrainian composer Mykola Lysenko. The work, charming and comic, and an escape from the grimness of Russian missile attacks, is called Natalka Poltavka, based on a play by Ivan Kotliarevsky, who pioneered Ukrainian-language literature in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Operas by Verdi, Puccini and Mozart, and ballets such as Giselle and La Sylphide, are on the playbill, despite the almost daily air raid sirens. But there is no Eugene Onegin in sight, nor a Queen of Spades, and not a whisper of those Tchaikovsky staples of ballet, Sleeping Beauty or Swan Lake. Russian literature and music, Russian culture of all kinds, is off the menu in wartime Ukraine. It is almost a shock to return to the UK and hear Russian music blithely played on Radio 3. This absence, some would say erasure, can be hard to comprehend outside Ukraine. When a symphony orchestra in Cardiff removed the 1812 Overture from a programme this spring, there was bafflement verging on an outcry: excising Tchaikovsky was allowing Vladimir Putin and his chums the satisfaction of “owning” Russian culture – it was censorship, it was playing into Russia’s hands. Tchaikovsky himself was not only long dead, but had been an outsider and an internationalist – so the various arguments went. It took some careful explanation to convey that a piece of music glorifying Russian military achievements, and involving actual cannons, might be somewhere beyond poor taste when Russia was at that moment shelling Ukrainian cities – particularly when the families of orchestra members were directly affected. Ukraine has accused Russia of looting empty homes in the southern city of Kherson and occupying them with troops in civilian clothes to prepare for street fighting in what both sides predict will be one of the war’s most important battles. In recent days, Russia has ordered civilians out of Kherson in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city, the only regional capital Moscow has seized since its invasion in February.

Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.” Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said.

An internal rift over the supply of deadly drones to Russia for use in Ukraine has opened up in Iran, with a prominent conservative cleric and newspaper editor saying Russia is the clear aggressor in the war and the supply should stop. A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military. Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has told Sky News in London that the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the country soon. Sunak had promised that Ukraine would be his first overseas port of call if he became PM, but in a high-profile U-turn has headed to Egypt and Cop 27 instead. Prystaiko said:“We’re not going to discuss the dates, because of the security of your prime minister. But he’s coming to Ukraine quite soon.” A senior adviser to Ukraine’s president has said Kyiv had never refused to negotiate with Moscow and that it was ready for talks with Russia’s future leader, but not with Vladimir Putin. The comments on Twitter by Mykhailo Podolyak followed a Washington Post report on Saturday saying the Biden administration was privately encouraging Ukraine’s leaders to signal an openness to negotiate with Moscow. “Ukraine has never refused to negotiate. Our negotiating position is known and open,” he wrote on Twitter, saying that Russia should first withdraw its troops from Ukraine. “Is Putin ready? Obviously not. Therefore, we are constructive in our assessment: we will talk with the next leader of [Russia].” The Russian president, Vladimir Putin, has said 50,000 Russian soldiers called up as part of his mobilisation drive were now fighting with combat units in Ukraine, the Interfax news agency reported. Putin said 80,000 were “in the zone of the special military operation” - the term Russia uses for its war in Ukraine – and the rest of the almost 320,000 draftees were at training camps in Russia. “We now have 50,000 in their combat units. The rest are not taking part in the fighting yet,” Interfax quoted Putin as saying during a visit to the Tver region, outside Moscow. In September, Putin announced a “partial mobilisation” drive to call up hundreds of thousands of new fighters for the war after Ukraine recaptured large swathes of territory in a counter-offensive. The move triggered an exodus of hundreds of thousands of Russians and triggered anti-war protests across the country, Reuters reported. The Guardian’s diplomatic editor, Patrick Wintour, reports: An internal rift over the supply of deadly drones to Russia for use in Ukraine has opened up in Iran, with a prominent conservative cleric and newspaper editor saying Russia is the clear aggressor in the war and the supply should stop. A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military. Iran has denied for more than two months that it sold the drones to Russia despite their use to target power stations and civilian infrastructure, but at the weekend said it had supplied a small number of drones before the war started, an explanation that has been rejected by the US and Ukraine. The row over the drones reflects a wider foreign policy debate in Tehran about the risks of developing close links with Moscow. It is also unusual, in that the criticism of Iran’s government is being led by a conservative cleric and a newspaper editor. In remarks picked up by other Iranian newspapers, Masih Mohajeri, writing on the front page of the newspaper Jomhouri-e-Islami, highlighted three things the government should have done: advised the party that started the war, ie Russia, to observe international regulations that prohibit encroachment on the territory of other countries; told Russia at the outset of the war that it had no right to use the drones in Ukraine that Iran had provided; maintained stronger relations with the invaded country. Read more of Patrick Wintour’s report here: Row brews in Iran over use of its drones in Ukraine war by Russia It is the 105th anniversary of the October revolution in Russia – celebrated on 7 November because of calendar changes – and so at the Red Square in Moscow today Communist party and “Left Front” supporters have been carrying placards of Lenin and Stalin at a flower-laying ceremony at the Lenin mausoleum. The revolution led to civil war and ultimately the creation of the Soviet Union. Maksym Kozytskyi, governor of Lviv, one of Ukraine’s westernmost regions, has announced preparation measures for receiving more refugees and internally displaced people into his region, and appealed for help with the provision of diesel generators and financial aid for medical supplies. In a message posted to Telegram, he said: Lviv oblast is among the five regions that received the largest number of forced migrants. Taking into account the fact that the occupier is targeting energy facilities, we expect a new wave of internally displaced people – from those regions where they will not be able to start the heating season. Therefore we are renovating dormitories in which no one has lived for a long time. They will serve as shelters for people who lost their homes due to Russia’s military actions. Funds from the regional budget are directed to repairs. Another important need of the Lviv region now is diesel generators. We want to provide them as much as possible for all important objects of the Lviv region, in particular medical and educational institutions, institutions where the elderly and disabled, and children without parents from among forced migrants are staying. Also, financial support is needed by medical institutions of our region, which have an increased need for medical supplies and equipment. The head of Ukraine’s Byzantine-rite Catholic Church met Pope Francis at the Vatican on Monday and said there can be no dialogue with Russia as long as Moscow considered the neighbour it invaded a colony to be subjugated. Major Archbishop Sviatoslav Shevchuk’s trip to visit the pontiff was his first trip outside Ukraine since the Russian invasion in February. He said he prefers to remain in Kyiv to be close to the people despite the bombings and hardships. “The war in Ukraine is a colonial war and peace proposals by Russia are proposals of colonial pacification,” he said after meeting the pope at the Vatican. Reuters reports that Shevchuk, who has several times urged the pope to visit Kyiv, gave Francis a piece of shrapnel from a Russian mine that destroyed the facade of a church in Irpin in March. “These proposals imply the negation of the existence of the Ukrainian people, their history, culture and even their church. It is the negation of the very right of the Ukrainian state to exist with the sovereignty and territorial integrity that is recognised by the international community,” Shevchuk said. “With these premises, Russia’s proposals lack a basis for dialogue,” he said. Earlier today, we reported that the Orthodox church of Ukraine allows worshippers to celebrate Christmas on 25 December, in a move that distances it from traditionally observing Christmas on 7 January, at the same time as the Moscow patriarchy, which has blessed Putin’s war. Patriarch Kirill, the head of the Russian Orthodox church, is a prominent supporter of Vladimir Putin and has said Russian soldiers who are killed will be cleansed of all their sins. You can read more about that from Luke Harding and Artem Mazhulin in Kyiv here: Orthodox church of Ukraine allows worshippers to celebrate Christmas on 25 December Ukraine has accused Russia of looting empty homes in the southern city of Kherson and occupying them with troops in civilian clothes to prepare for street fighting in what both sides predict will be one of the war’s most important battles. In recent days, Russia has ordered civilians out of Kherson in anticipation of a Ukrainian assault to recapture the city, the only regional capital Moscow has seized since its invasion in February, Reuters reported. Kherson, with a pre-war population of nearly 300,000, has been left cold and dark after power and water were cut to the surrounding area over the past 48 hours, both sides said. Russian-installed officials blamed Ukrainian “sabotage” and said they were working to restore electricity. Ukrainian officials said the Russians had dismantled 1.5km of power lines, and electricity probably would not return until Ukrainian forces recapture the area. Kyiv has described the evacuation of the area as a forced deportation, a war crime. Moscow says it is sending residents away for safety. Three top Ukrainian officials confirmed that the shares of five strategic companies had been taken over by the defence ministry under wartime laws. The decision was taken at a top security meeting on 5 November and came into force the following day, security council secretary Oleksiy Danilov told a briefing today. Russia’s defence ministry took the unusual step of denying reports by Russian military bloggers that a naval infantry unit had lost hundreds of men in a fruitless offensive in eastern Ukraine, the state-owned RIA news agency said. It said the ministry had rejected the bloggers’ assertions that the 155th marine brigade of the Pacific Fleet had suffered “high, pointless losses in people and equipment”. On the contrary, in the course of 10 days the unit had advanced 5km (more than three miles) into Ukrainian defensive positions south-west of Donetsk, RIA quoted the ministry as saying. It specifically denied that the brigade’s commanders had shown incompetence, Reuters reported. “Due to the competent actions of the unit commanders, the losses of marines for the given period do not exceed 1% of combat strength, and 7% wounded, a significant part of whom have already returned to duty,” it said. The rare denial suggested the reports had touched a raw nerve at a point in the war’s ninth month when Russian forces are under heavy pressure in partly occupied regions of Ukraine that Moscow has proclaimed as its own territory – actions denounced as illegal by Kyiv, the west and most countries of the United Nations. Ukraine has received its first delivery of Nasams and Apside air defence systems, the country’s defence minister, Oleksii Reznikov, announced today. “We will continue to shoot down the enemy targets attacking us. Thank you to our partners: Norway, Spain and the US,” Reznikov wrote on Twitter. A spokesperson for the German government on Monday said it was up to Ukraine to decide when to hold peace talks with Russia, adding that Moscow had also been reluctant to participate in them. The Washington Post reported that the US has been privately encouraging Ukraine to signal it is open to talks with Russia, after the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, ruled out negotiations while the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, is in power. The Kremlin has declined to comment on a Wall Street Journal report that Washington had held undisclosed talks with top Russian officials about avoiding further escalation in the Ukraine war. According to the report, US national security adviser Jake Sullivan held talks with aides to president Vladimir Putin in the hope of reducing the risk that the war in Ukraine spills over or escalates into a nuclear conflict. “We have nothing to say about this publication,” Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. He also declined to comment on a Washington Post report that the US has been privately encouraging Ukraine to signal it is open to talks with Russia, after Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskiy ruled out negotiations while Putin is in power. “Well, we don’t know if that’s the case or not,” said Peskov. “Once again I repeat that there are some truthful reports, but for the most part there are reports that are pure speculation,” he said. Ukraine is bracing for power blackouts and fresh Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday, said Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital. Planned blackouts are scheduled to hit seven regions of Ukraine throughout Monday, according to Ukraine’s state-run energy company. The regions include the city of Kyiv, and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava. Kyiv’s mayor has urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family. Vitali Klitschko told residents to “consider everything” including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, echoed Klitschko’s words about evacuating Kyiv’s residents, saying: “I hope it won’t come to this, and we’re still trying to renew all electric facilities, generating stations, the transformations, all of it. If it comes to it, we’ll have to move them back to west of Ukraine, Lviv and all the places closer to the European Union. That’s a huge number of people to be located but Ukrainian winters can become quite harsh. We have to think how we do it.” Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti reported Monday that President Vladimir Putin will make a decision on whether to attend the next G20 summit in person by the end of the week. Zelenskiy has said he will not attend if Putin does. The summit in Bali is due to begin on Tuesday 15 November. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on his daily call on Monday that while Russia remains “open” to talks, it is unable to negotiate with Kyiv due to its refusal to hold talks with Russia. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that “farmers’ warehouses, a cultural site, and private houses” were damaged in Zaporizhzhia region by Russian strikes, and according to local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko Russian forces have killed one civilian in Bakhmut and wounded five civilians elsewhere in the Donetsk region. Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, has said he expects the battle of Kherson to be the defining battle of the war. Russian state-owned news agency Tass quoted him saying: “We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere.’” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK has told Sky News in London that the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the country soon. Sunak had promised that Ukraine would be his first overseas port of call if he became PM, but in a high-profile U-turn has headed to Egypt and Cop 27 instead. Prystaiko said:“We’re not going to discuss the dates, because of the security of your prime minister. But he’s coming to Ukraine quite soon.” That is it from me, Martin Belam, for now. I will be back later. Tom Ambrose will be with you shortly. Russian state-owned news agency RIA Novosti is reporting that President Vladimir Putin will make a decision on whether to attend the next G20 summit in person by the end of the week. It cited Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has said he will not attend if Putin does. The summit in Bali is due to begin Tuesday 15 November. Speaking on Sky News earlier today, Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, echoed the Kyiv mayor’s words that it might become necessary to evacuate the city if Russian attacks on Ukraine’s power supplies continue. Prystaiko told viewers: I hope it won’t come to this, and we’re still trying to renew all electric facilities, generating stations, the transformations, all of it. If it comes to it, we’ll have to move them back to west west of Ukraine, Lviv and all the places closer to the European Union. That’s a huge number of people to be located but Ukrainian winters can become quite harsh. We have to think how we do it. He said that in terms of power generation there was not a problem, as there are many households who have already been evacuated so are bot using electricity, and the economy is not running at full tilt, however transmission and the damage to power lines was the problem. Reuters reports that Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told the media on his daily call today that while Russia remains “open” to talks, it is unable to negotiate with Kyiv due to its refusal to hold talks with Russia. Vadym Prystaiko, Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, has claimed that Iranian drones are being stockpiled in Belarus to the north of Ukraine, “quite close to Kyiv” and are Ukraine’s “biggest problem”. He told viewers of Sky News that “we managed to take from the sky around 70-75% of all the drones and rockets. They are running out of rockets, that is for sure. Today, the Russian fleet did not leave their bases for the sea where they launched their rockets at us. But the Iranian drones, this is the biggest problem. They are cheap … they come in a swarm. Very difficult to deal with.” He called for political pressure and sanctions on Iran, saying “we have evidence that thousands and thousands of them have been provided, some of them stored now in Belarus, which is on top and north of Ukraine, quite close to Kyiv city for example.” He continued “We have to cover the skies for Ukraine. It means sometimes planes, and in most of the cases rockets, anti-air. We also have to increase pressure on Russia and Iran as well. With Iran, political sanctions, more or less the same as Russia, just to keep them under pressure, until they won’t be any more able to send rockets or build new.” Ukraine’s ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, has told Sky News in London that the new British prime minister, Rishi Sunak, will visit the country soon. Sunak had promised that Ukraine would be his first overseas port of call if he became PM, but in a high-profile U-turn has headed to Egypt and Cop 27 instead. Prystaiko said: We’re not going to discuss the dates, because of the security of your prime minister. But he’s coming to Ukraine quite soon. The Kyiv Independent is reporting that “farmers’ warehouses, a cultural site, and private houses” were damaged in Zaporizhzhia region by Russian strikes, and according to local governor Pavlo Kyrylenko Russian forces have killed one civilian in Bakhmut and wounded five civilians elsewhere in the Donetsk region. The chiefly unrecognised authorities in the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) in the occupied east of Ukraine have issued their daily operational briefing. They claim that overnight one civilian has been killed and three injured after Ukrainian forces shelled eight settlements that the DPR occupies. In addition, they claim that 31 housing and five civil infrastructure facilities were damaged. The claims have not been independently verified. The DPR is one of the regions that Russia claims to have annexed. Russian state-owned news agency Tass is carrying quotes from Serbia’s president, Aleksandar Vučić, who says he expects the battle for Kherson to be the decisive event of the war in Ukraine. He is quoted as saying: We have a difficult time ahead of us, next winter will be even more difficult than this one, because we are facing the Battle of Stalingrad, the decisive battle in the war in Ukraine, the battle for Kherson, in which both sides use thousands of tanks, aircraft, artillery. The west thinks that in this way it will be able to destroy Russia, Russia believes that in this way it will be able to protect what it took at the beginning of the war and bring the war to an end. This will create additional problems everywhere. The British ambassador to Ukraine, Melinda Simmons, has described on Twitter the situation this morning in Kyiv as “calm”. Dmytro Zhyvytskyi, governor of Sumy, has posted to say that the night was chiefly quiet in his region of Ukraine. He claimed that there were four explosions in Seredyna-Buda, “without consequences”. Planned blackouts are scheduled to hit seven regions of Ukraine throughout Monday, according to Ukraine’s state-run energy company. The regions include the city of Kyiv, and the regions of Kyiv, Chernihiv, Cherkasy, Zhytomyr, Sumy, Kharkiv and Poltava. The occupied city of Kherson has lost power for the first time since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. In a statement on Telegram, the Russian-controlled Kherson administration said electricity and water supplies were down after a “terrorist attack” damaged three power lines on the Berislav-Kakhovka highway in an occupied part of the region. Yuriy Sobolevskyi, deputy head of Kherson regional council, said about 10 settlements in the region were affected, as well as the main city. Russian officials have said Ukraine is preparing to attempt a second offensive to retake more of the Kherson region. Recapturing it would have immense symbolic and logistical value for Ukraine as Russia wants the area to secure a water supply to Crimea, as well as a land bridge to Russia. The head of the regional administration, Yaroslav Yanushevych, blamed Russia for the power outages. He said that in the city of Beryslav in the region, about 1.5km (one mile) of electric power lines had been destroyed, cutting off power entirely because the “damage is quite extensive”. Energy specialists were working to “quickly” resolve the issue, the Russian-backed authorities said, as they called on people to “remain calm”. Kherson’s Moscow-appointed governor, Vladimir Saldo, said authorities hoped to have power back by the end of Monday. News of the outage followed claims on Sunday in Russian state media that the Kakhovka dam in the region of Kherson was damaged by a Ukrainian strike using Himars rockets. In recent weeks, Ukraine has warned that Moscow’s forces intended to blow up the strategic facility to cause flooding. The hydroelectric dam was captured by Moscow’s forces at the start of their offensive. Kyiv’s mayor has told residents to consider leaving the capital in the event of a complete blackout. Vitali Klitschko said he could not rule out the prospect of a complete blackout for the capital as Russia continued its campaign of strikes on energy infrastructure. Speaking to Ukraine’s United News, a centralised news programme broadcast across all channels, Klitschko told people to prepare by buying power banks and warm clothes. In case of an all-out blackout, he said Kyiv’s residents should try to stay with relatives outside the capital. If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time,” he said. However, Klitschko urged people in Kyiv not to be “pessimistic”, saying he was only advising people to prepare for different scenarios. “We will do everything that depends on us so that such a scenario does not happen.” As of Sunday evening, stabilisation blackouts continue in Kyiv and six regions, Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said. Describing the situation as “really difficult” he said more than 4.5m Ukrainians – mostly in Kyiv and the surrounding region – were without electricity. Volodymyr Zelenskiy has warned of continued “mass attacks” on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure. The Ukrainian president said in his latest Sunday evening address: We also understand that the terrorist state is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of mass attacks on our infrastructure. First of all, energy. In particular, for this, Russia needs Iranian missiles. We are preparing to respond.” Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said earlier on Twitter that Ukraine would “stand” despite Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure, adding that this would be done by using air defence, protecting infrastructure and optimising consumption. Russian strikes over the past month have destroyed around a third of Ukraine’s power stations and the government has urged Ukrainians to conserve electricity as much as possible. Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital, said Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said. Ukraine’s authorities have issued scheduled blackouts across the country in order to stabilise the grid, and 17 EU countries have sent 500 power generators to Ukraine to help ease the energy crisis. Hello and welcome back to the Guardian’s live coverage of the war in Ukraine. I’m Samantha Lock and I’ll be bringing you all the latest developments as they unfold over the next few hours. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, has warned of continued Russian “mass attacks” on the country’s energy infrastructure as Ukraine reels from the destruction of around a third of its power stations. Kyiv’s mayor, Vitali Klitschko, has told residents to consider leaving the capital in the event of a complete blackout. For any updates or feedback you wish to share, please feel free to get in touch via email or Twitter. If you have just joined us, here are all the latest developments: Ukraine is bracing for power blackouts and fresh Russian attacks on its energy infrastructure. Russia “is concentrating forces and means for a possible repetition of massive attacks on our infrastructure, primarily energy”, said Volodymyr Zelenskiy, the Ukrainian president. Ukraine faced a 32% deficit in projected power supply on Monday, said Sergei Kovalenko, CEO of Yasno, a major supplier of energy to the capital. “This is a lot, and it’s force majeure,” he said. About 500 power generators were being sent to Ukraine by 17 EU countries as 4.5m Ukrainians were left without power. Kyiv’s mayor urged residents to prepare for a worst-case scenario by making emergency plans to leave the city and stay with friends or family. Vitali Klitschko urged residents to “consider everything” including loss of power and water. “If you have extended family or friends outside Kyiv, where there is autonomous water supply, an oven, heating, please keep in mind the possibility of staying there for a certain amount of time.” Ukraine’s Russian-occupied city of Kherson was cut off from water and electricity supplies on Sunday after an airstrike and damage to the Kakhovka dam, local officials said. “In Kherson and a number of other areas in the region, there is temporarily no electricity or water supply,” the city’s Moscow-installed administration said on Telegram. Russia accused Ukraine of an act of “sabotage”. Ukraine’s military said Russia was urging residents of Kherson to evacuate as soon as possible, sending them warning messages on their phones on Sunday. Russian soldiers warned civilians that Ukraine’s army was preparing for a massive attack and told people to leave for the city’s right bank immediately. Nataliya Humenyuk, a spokesperson for Ukraine’s southern forces, said Russia was “occupying and evacuating” Kherson simultaneously, trying to convince Ukrainians its force are leaving when in fact they are digging in. The Kremlin-installed administration in Kherson already has expelled tens of thousands of civilians from the city. Russian forces are stepping up their strikes in a fiercely contested region of eastern Ukraine, worsening the already tough conditions for residents and the Ukrainian army, Ukrainian authorities said. “Very fierce Russian attacks on Donetsk region are continuing. The enemy is suffering serious losses there,” Zelenskiy said in his nightly video address. US officials have reportedly warned the Ukrainian government in private that it needs to signal an openness to negotiating with Russia. Officials in Washington warned that “Ukraine fatigue” among allies could worsen if Kyiv continued to be closed to negotiations, the Washington Post reported. US officials told the paper that Ukraine’s position on negotiations with Russia was wearing thin among allies worried about the economic effects of a protracted war. External power was restored to Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant two days after it was disconnected from the power grid when Russian shelling damaged high voltage lines, the UN nuclear watchdog said. Europe’s largest nuclear plant needs electricity to maintain vital cooling systems, but it had been running on emergency diesel generators since Russian shelling severed its outside connections. The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, held secretive talks with top Russian officials in hopes of reducing the risk of nuclear conflict, the Wall Street Journal has reported. It cited US and allied officials as saying that Sullivan held previously undisclosed conversations in recent months with the Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov and the Russian security council secretary Nikolai Patrushev, Sullivan’s counterpart. The White House declined to comment on the report.","charCount":"45057","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/tom-ambrose\">Tom Ambrose</a> (now); <a href=\"profile/martin-belam\">Martin Belam</a> and <a href=\"profile/samantha-lock\">Samantha Lock</a> (earlier)"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/news","pillarName":"News"},{"id":"tv-and-radio/2022/nov/07/princess-anne-actor-says-disclaimers-on-the-crown-would-patronise-viewers","type":"article","sectionId":"tv-and-radio","sectionName":"Television & radio","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T17:05:38Z","webTitle":"Princess Anne actor says disclaimers on The Crown would ‘patronise’ viewers","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/07/princess-anne-actor-says-disclaimers-on-the-crown-would-patronise-viewers","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/tv-and-radio/2022/nov/07/princess-anne-actor-says-disclaimers-on-the-crown-would-patronise-viewers","fields":{"headline":"Princess Anne actor says disclaimers on The Crown would ‘patronise’ viewers","standfirst":"<p>Claudia Harrison, who plays Queen’s daughter, responds to criticism of drama for imagining situations involving real people</p>","trailText":"Claudia Harrison, who plays Queen’s daughter, responds to criticism of drama for imagining situations involving real people","byline":"Caroline Davies","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9650d5fbe89ede95955ddd77bded99780f0eac6b\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9650d5fbe89ede95955ddd77bded99780f0eac6b/286_0_2917_1750/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Claudia Harrison as Princess Anne in season five of The Crown\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Claudia Harrison as Princess Anne in season five of The Crown, which begins this month.

Claudia Harrison, 46, was responding to criticism of the drama after the Queen’s death, which included former prime ministers Sir John Major and Sir Tony Blair objecting to their depictions – while Dame Judi Dench called for a disclaimer to be added to each episode. Harrison, who takes over the role from Erin Doherty just as The Crown examines the Queen’s “annus horribilis” of 1992, said she was “incredibly excited” to be part of such a “beautifully, meticulously researched piece of historical fiction”. Of the criticism, she said: “That debate has been there, understandably, through the context of the time we are living through. And that’s fine. And I think we have moved on, haven’t we, into a more nuanced area where as an actor – I have to talk about it only as that – I think my job is always to respect the intelligence of the audience.” “To patronise the audiences worldwide, and to think people are genuinely sitting down thinking this is a documentary and that everything they see is fact, I feel uncomfortable with that,” she added. “Patronise an audience at your peril.” She said the show, set to premiere on 9 November, looked at the imagined conversations behind closed doors “with an enormous amount of respect and research”. As an actor, she was “incredibly uncomfortable” with the idea of putting disclaimers on art. She added we live in a world where “the story behind who wears the crown is a legitimate subject for us to examine as creatives. Well, thank God we live in a world with free press and free cultural landscape” Harrison, a mother of three, who, like the Princess Royal, also lives on a working farm, took her preparations for the role very seriously. She said: “As an actor I enjoy getting into the meat of something like that, so I read the books, the research team on The Crown is exceptional, and I read Princess Anne’s book Riding Through My Life. And it was very illuminating.” Anne was an Olympian, a professional athlete, a working mother, a patron of hundreds of charities and organisations – an “exceptional woman”, she added. “She wants to be well briefed. She comes into a room. She is not there to decorate it, but there to do a job, get to know people. It’s never about her. That sort of workman-like, businesslike aspect to her is so refreshing.” By series five, Anne is newly divorced. “Time has passed since the last series. Whereas, perhaps in series three and four, everyone had so much to hope for, now we find a different royal family. We are older, we’re tireder, we’ve been doing the job a long time, and the duty has set in, and that is a really interesting thing to look at.” She hopes her portrayal of Anne will convey “her wit and her sense of humour”. “Look at what she has done. With her role as the Princess Royal, she has been exceptional, and I hope The Crown is part of turning her into a feminist icon,” she said. Of landing the role, Harrison, who has appeared in Humans and The IT Crowd, said: “I would love to play the cool card and go ‘no no no it’s just another part’. But of course this is a huge show, with a huge, huge audience. And to be part of that is so unbelievably exciting,” she said.","charCount":"3336","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/carolinedavies\">Caroline Davies</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/arts","pillarName":"Arts"},{"id":"football/2022/nov/07/red-cards-a-rocket-and-a-ruckus-seville-derby-ends-in-glorious-chaos","type":"article","sectionId":"football","sectionName":"Football","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T15:46:22Z","webTitle":"Red cards, a rocket and a ruckus: Seville derby ends in glorious chaos | Sid Lowe","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/07/red-cards-a-rocket-and-a-ruckus-seville-derby-ends-in-glorious-chaos","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/football/2022/nov/07/red-cards-a-rocket-and-a-ruckus-seville-derby-ends-in-glorious-chaos","fields":{"headline":"Red cards, a rocket and a ruckus: Seville derby ends in glorious chaos","standfirst":"<p>With four sendings-off, a comical own goal and a belting late equaliser from Nemanja Gudelj, the game lived up to its billing</p>","trailText":"With four sendings-off, a comical own goal and a belting late equaliser from Nemanja Gudelj, the game lived up to its billing","byline":"Sid Lowe","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"023baf0f2c436bba73ddbb5ace99d8c16064990c\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/023baf0f2c436bba73ddbb5ace99d8c16064990c/0_125_4071_2443/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nemanja Gudelj celebrates after securing a draw for Sevilla against fierce rivals Real Betis\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nemanja Gudelj celebrates after securing a draw for Sevilla against fierce rivals Real Betis.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Ángel Martínez/Getty Images</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure>","body":"<p>“Well, this <em>is</em> a derby,” Real Betis’s Edgar González was saying, but it was hard not to be drawn to the pitch behind him where opponent Nemanja Gudelj was pacing about shaking his head. At the final whistle, the Sevilla defender had covered his face with his hands and just stood doubled over, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/sidlowe/status/1589581757409525765?s=20&amp;t=r62SA4IWfaIaooqRz9JvZg\">elbows on knees</a>. Ivan Rakitic approached and they went through it once more, although it was a wonder they could hear anything. Next was Jesús Navas, the pair picking over the moment a vital victory slipped away. Now, waiting near the touchline for his turn to talk, they were going to ask Gudelj to relive it all over again on camera. He bit his lip, smiled and said: “I’m a bit angry with myself. I should have hit it better.”</p> \n<p>Better?! The 138th Seville derby had finished 1-1 and Gudelj, son of a footballer and a basketball player, brother of a footballer and a tennis player, had scored the equaliser that earned Sevilla a precious point which pulled them out of the relegation zone. He had done so with an outrageous shot from somewhere over the other side of the Triana Bridge. “<em>Buenisimo</em>,” said the man he beat. It was only his second goal for Sevilla – his first had been an equally absurd effort from a similar place that secured victory in Mallorca three weeks earlier – and it could <em>not </em>have been hit better, the scoreboard behind the net flashing up <em>golazos</em> with impeccable and accidental timing as it tore 32 yards through the air.</p> \n<aside class=\"element element-rich-link element--thumbnail\"> \n <p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/nov/06/european-roundup-union-berlin-denied-top-spot-after-leverkusen-thrashing\">European roundup: Filip Kostic inspires Juventus in defeat of Internazionale</a> </p> \n</aside> \n<p>Gudelj, though, was not really focused on that any more, but on what had come next. The clock had shown 80.58 when the ball raced past Claudio Bravo and into the net. It had shown 89.11 when he had controlled it on his chest and sent a ludicrous 20-yard volley crashing against the bar, the TV director deciding to turn away and focus on something else as it looped straight up into the sky and almost dropped down over the line. And it had shown 94.52 (of 95.04) when he had hit a first-time effort, bending and flying towards the top of the net from just beyond the penalty spot, only for Bravo to throw up a hand for a superb save.</p> \n<p>In less than a quarter of an hour Gudelj could have scored three times as many as in his previous 127 games for the club put together. He could have scored the most ridiculously brilliant hat-trick ever – now <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/posts/72009420?utm_campaign=postshare_creator\">there’s a debate</a> for you: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGcgSQRdNww\">Rivaldo, surely</a>? – from a combined distance not far off 90 yards. In a derby. <a href=\"https://www.espn.com/soccer/spanish-laliga/story/4602414/sevillareal-betis-is-laligas-best-rivalryand-in-a-city-that-lives-for-the-sport\">Maybe the most passionate on earth</a>. As a centre-back. A derby that his team desperately needed to win, too. But the closer he got to the goal, the further his shot got from being one and now he was kicking himself. “I needed to hit more to one side, I made it a bit too easy for Bravo,” he said, which was harsh on both of them.</p> \n<p>Defeat probably would have been, too. “It would have been a pity to have conceded then,” Bravo said. This was one of those derbies where no one was satisfied, but actually they sort of all were, exhausted and, like the fan <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mariaarodicio/status/1589342452745658368?s=20&amp;t=r62SA4IWfaIaooqRz9JvZg\">whose traffic light tower gave way on him</a>, barely able to walk any more but basically unscathed. A game, Joan Jordán said, “where so much happened”: “A mad, mad, mad derby” as the headline in <em>Diario de Sevilla</em> had it. One that started with the first foul after 13 seconds and the second after 49, retaliation in early, and ran well beyond 100 minutes, that will keep running all week and beyond. A game marked by four red cards, 10 yellow cards, and a blue tracksuit, Jorge Sampaoli bouncing about on the touchline chewing anxiously on the draw strings of his hoodie. And ultimately decided by one stupid goal and one sensational one. That and a guy in the VAR room back in Las Rozas, 536km away.</p> \n<p>Well, him and the anxiety that Manuel Pellegrini had warned them about. “They can’t let themselves get carried away by that,” Betis’s coach had said before, but they did; “The hatchet is never buried in a derby,” he said after. Unless it’s in someone’s leg.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"9e8b7b2192e906c2fc3e26392c1dfd82b3294dfd\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/9e8b7b2192e906c2fc3e26392c1dfd82b3294dfd/0_0_3374_2024/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Gonzalo Montiel hacks down Álex Moreno\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Gonzalo Montiel hacks down Álex Moreno.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: José Manuel Vidal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>Betis’s fans had hoped to slip in the knife, anyway. They had not had a lead like this over Sevilla for two decades but things were shifting. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/apr/24/real-betis-valencia-copa-del-rey-final-match-report\">Holders of the Copa del Rey</a>, having knocked out Sevilla en route<em> </em>in a game that had initially been abandoned <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2022/jan/15/sevillas-derby-with-betis-suspended-after-player-is-struck-by-missile\">after a flag pole hit Jordán</a> – something Betis’s fans reminded them of with a pre-match banner covering an entire end and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/tsf_podcast/status/1589589972541378560?s=20&amp;t=r62SA4IWfaIaooqRz9JvZg\">depicting Jordán, the stick, and Pinocchio</a> – Betis were in a Champions League place at the start of the evening, third within reach. Sevilla, by contrast, were clinging on to the league itself, down in the bottom three. <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2022/sep/05/sevilla-slump-to-barcelona-showcases-sense-of-ambition-gone-awry-la-liga\">Julen Lopetegui had been sacked</a>, but things had not improved: Sevilla had won once under Sampaoli and just didn’t look very good, like a relegation battle might actually be a reality. No one would have enjoyed that more than their neighbours.</p> \n<p>Soon, things looked even worse for Sevilla. Navas was 49 seconds into a record 22nd derby in <em>primera </em>when he sent the ball flying past the goalkeeper’s hand, off the post and into the net. It was his own net and it was that kind of game. He had come on as a first-half sub after Gonzalo Montiel was handed a red card for a wild, flying tackle, studs connecting with Álex Moreno’s knee. At first the referee, Sánchez Martínez, had only given a yellow, but the replays saw that upgraded, Montiel losing his mind and having to be dragged off the pitch by teammates. Betis, who had already had chances for Aitor Ruibal, Moreno and Nabil Fekir, were a goal and a man up.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-tweet\" data-canonical-url=\"https://twitter.com/ViaplaySportsUK/status/1589374767844380672\"> \n <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\">\n  <p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">OH MY WORD! 😱😱<br><br>Nemanja Gudelj brings Sevilla level with a ROCKET! 🚀 <a href=\"https://t.co/y85tnB73FV\">pic.twitter.com/y85tnB73FV</a></p>— Viaplay Sports UK (@ViaplaySportsUK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ViaplaySportsUK/status/1589374767844380672?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 6, 2022</a>\n </blockquote> \n</figure> \n<p>It didn’t last, the scene repeated twice more. That was 38 minutes in. On 45, Fekir got a yellow that was turned into a red for an arm in the face of Papu Gómez – who, despite being an opponent, seemed to suggest afterwards that he felt the card was excessive punishment, claiming that the game “is contact and it’s losing its essence”. Then Borja Iglesias put his studs down Jordán’s ankle and was handed a yellow card that was also turned into a red on 48 minutes (which was weird, because he had his best chance with a one-on-one on 55 – explained by the 10 minutes of time added at the end of the first half before the clock started again on 45 in the second.) A fourth red was later handed to Betis’s goalkeeper coach Toni Doblas.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-atom\"> <gu-atom data-atom-id=\"873c50fa-5d42-439e-9daf-3a5e0b65b2cf\" data-atom-type=\"guide\"> \n  <div>\n   <div class=\"atom-Guide\">\n    <p></p>\n    <p>Girona 2-1 Athletic Club, Getafe 0-0 Cádiz, Valladolid 2-1 Elche, Celta Vigo 1-2 Osasuna, Barcelona 2-0 Almería, Atlético Madrid 1-1 Espanyol, Real Sociedad 1-1 Valencia, Villarreal 0-2 Mallorca, Real Betis 1-1 Sevilla</p>\n    <p><b>Monday: </b>Rayo Vallecano v Real Madrid</p>\n    <p></p>\n   </div>\n  </div>\n </gu-atom> \n</figure> \n<p>From a goal and a man up, Betis now faced 40 minutes or so a man down, just eight outfield players on the pitch, all plans turned on their head. All post-match judgements too. There could be no analysis without the cards, each side clinging to the bit that suited them and the discourse of disappointment, a little more happy than they would admit. “We deserved to win,” Sampaoli said. “We feel like it’s two points lost,” Pellegrini replied.</p> \n<p>“We spent the whole of the second half in their goal,” Sampaoli insisted. But González was immense – he made four vital interceptions – Jordán complained that his Sevilla team had attacked “badly” and Pellegrini said Betis mostly kept them at a distance. Just not quite enough distance to stop Gudelj smashing in a sensational equaliser. “I practise them from there in training and when I hit it, I felt it was going in,” he said. “We all went mad of course, celebrating like a family.”</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-image element--showcase\" data-media-id=\"bd4a92f4022e47ee00b6247563e1e4802cc39be0\"> \n <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/bd4a92f4022e47ee00b6247563e1e4802cc39be0/0_121_3376_2026/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Nabil Fekir sees red\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\"> \n <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Nabil Fekir sees red.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: José Manuel Vidal/EPA</span> \n </figcaption> \n</figure> \n<p>A frantic finish was set up but, when he got another chance with the very last attack only to see the ball pushed away, Gudelj slipped to his knees, unable to forget about it. For a moment it looked like he was sobbing. The anger was still there at full time and, asked afterwards if this point was any use to them, Jordán replied with a single word: “No.”</p> \n<p>Yet this draw took Sevilla out of the relegation zone, a little light brought back in, one of those moments they could all hang on to, the kind of experience that sometimes forges teams. Up at the top of the north stand, meanwhile, 400 of the 10,000 fans who requested tickets were going wild. Below them, so was the sporting director, Monchi, beating at his chest and blowing kisses, getting into another confrontation when he finally made way, Sergio Canales among those having a few choice words. Down in the tunnel, the referee’s report said, there was an “altercation”: when he had come out to see what was going on, though, they all scarpered like schoolkids the moment teacher turns up. “We weren’t able to identify any of them,” he wrote.</p> \n<p>“When you celebrate a draw, there’s nothing more to say,” Betis midfielder Guido Rodríguez claimed, but there’s always something to say. “Well, this <em>is</em> a derby,” said González as Gudelj paced about behind him.</p> \n<figure class=\"element element-table\"

this is a derby,” Real Betis’s Edgar González was saying, but it was hard not to be drawn to the pitch behind him where opponent Nemanja Gudelj was pacing about shaking his head. At the final whistle, the Sevilla defender had covered his face with his hands and just stood doubled over, elbows on knees. Ivan Rakitic approached and they went through it once more, although it was a wonder they could hear anything. Next was Jesús Navas, the pair picking over the moment a vital victory slipped away. Now, waiting near the touchline for his turn to talk, they were going to ask Gudelj to relive it all over again on camera. He bit his lip, smiled and said: “I’m a bit angry with myself. I should have hit it better.” Better?! The 138th Seville derby had finished 1-1 and Gudelj, son of a footballer and a basketball player, brother of a footballer and a tennis player, had scored the equaliser that earned Sevilla a precious point which pulled them out of the relegation zone. He had done so with an outrageous shot from somewhere over the other side of the Triana Bridge. “Buenisimo,” said the man he beat. It was only his second goal for Sevilla – his first had been an equally absurd effort from a similar place that secured victory in Mallorca three weeks earlier – and it could not have been hit better, the scoreboard behind the net flashing up golazos with impeccable and accidental timing as it tore 32 yards through the air. Gudelj, though, was not really focused on that any more, but on what had come next. The clock had shown 80.58 when the ball raced past Claudio Bravo and into the net. It had shown 89.11 when he had controlled it on his chest and sent a ludicrous 20-yard volley crashing against the bar, the TV director deciding to turn away and focus on something else as it looped straight up into the sky and almost dropped down over the line. And it had shown 94.52 (of 95.04) when he had hit a first-time effort, bending and flying towards the top of the net from just beyond the penalty spot, only for Bravo to throw up a hand for a superb save. In less than a quarter of an hour Gudelj could have scored three times as many as in his previous 127 games for the club put together. He could have scored the most ridiculously brilliant hat-trick ever – now there’s a debate for you: Rivaldo, surely? – from a combined distance not far off 90 yards. In a derby. Maybe the most passionate on earth. As a centre-back. A derby that his team desperately needed to win, too. But the closer he got to the goal, the further his shot got from being one and now he was kicking himself. “I needed to hit more to one side, I made it a bit too easy for Bravo,” he said, which was harsh on both of them. Defeat probably would have been, too. “It would have been a pity to have conceded then,” Bravo said. This was one of those derbies where no one was satisfied, but actually they sort of all were, exhausted and, like the fan whose traffic light tower gave way on him, barely able to walk any more but basically unscathed. A game, Joan Jordán said, “where so much happened”: “A mad, mad, mad derby” as the headline in Diario de Sevilla had it. One that started with the first foul after 13 seconds and the second after 49, retaliation in early, and ran well beyond 100 minutes, that will keep running all week and beyond. A game marked by four red cards, 10 yellow cards, and a blue tracksuit, Jorge Sampaoli bouncing about on the touchline chewing anxiously on the draw strings of his hoodie. And ultimately decided by one stupid goal and one sensational one. That and a guy in the VAR room back in Las Rozas, 536km away. Well, him and the anxiety that Manuel Pellegrini had warned them about. “They can’t let themselves get carried away by that,” Betis’s coach had said before, but they did; “The hatchet is never buried in a derby,” he said after. Unless it’s in someone’s leg. Betis’s fans had hoped to slip in the knife, anyway. They had not had a lead like this over Sevilla for two decades but things were shifting. Holders of the Copa del Rey, having knocked out Sevilla en route in a game that had initially been abandoned after a flag pole hit Jordán – something Betis’s fans reminded them of with a pre-match banner covering an entire end and depicting Jordán, the stick, and Pinocchio – Betis were in a Champions League place at the start of the evening, third within reach. Sevilla, by contrast, were clinging on to the league itself, down in the bottom three. Julen Lopetegui had been sacked, but things had not improved: Sevilla had won once under Sampaoli and just didn’t look very good, like a relegation battle might actually be a reality. No one would have enjoyed that more than their neighbours. Soon, things looked even worse for Sevilla. Navas was 49 seconds into a record 22nd derby in primera when he sent the ball flying past the goalkeeper’s hand, off the post and into the net. It was his own net and it was that kind of game. He had come on as a first-half sub after Gonzalo Montiel was handed a red card for a wild, flying tackle, studs connecting with Álex Moreno’s knee. At first the referee, Sánchez Martínez, had only given a yellow, but the replays saw that upgraded, Montiel losing his mind and having to be dragged off the pitch by teammates. Betis, who had already had chances for Aitor Ruibal, Moreno and Nabil Fekir, were a goal and a man up. It didn’t last, the scene repeated twice more. That was 38 minutes in. On 45, Fekir got a yellow that was turned into a red for an arm in the face of Papu Gómez – who, despite being an opponent, seemed to suggest afterwards that he felt the card was excessive punishment, claiming that the game “is contact and it’s losing its essence”. Then Borja Iglesias put his studs down Jordán’s ankle and was handed a yellow card that was also turned into a red on 48 minutes (which was weird, because he had his best chance with a one-on-one on 55 – explained by the 10 minutes of time added at the end of the first half before the clock started again on 45 in the second.) A fourth red was later handed to Betis’s goalkeeper coach Toni Doblas. From a goal and a man up, Betis now faced 40 minutes or so a man down, just eight outfield players on the pitch, all plans turned on their head. All post-match judgements too. There could be no analysis without the cards, each side clinging to the bit that suited them and the discourse of disappointment, a little more happy than they would admit. “We deserved to win,” Sampaoli said. “We feel like it’s two points lost,” Pellegrini replied. “We spent the whole of the second half in their goal,” Sampaoli insisted. But González was immense – he made four vital interceptions – Jordán complained that his Sevilla team had attacked “badly” and Pellegrini said Betis mostly kept them at a distance. Just not quite enough distance to stop Gudelj smashing in a sensational equaliser. “I practise them from there in training and when I hit it, I felt it was going in,” he said. “We all went mad of course, celebrating like a family.” A frantic finish was set up but, when he got another chance with the very last attack only to see the ball pushed away, Gudelj slipped to his knees, unable to forget about it. For a moment it looked like he was sobbing. The anger was still there at full time and, asked afterwards if this point was any use to them, Jordán replied with a single word: “No.” Yet this draw took Sevilla out of the relegation zone, a little light brought back in, one of those moments they could all hang on to, the kind of experience that sometimes forges teams. Up at the top of the north stand, meanwhile, 400 of the 10,000 fans who requested tickets were going wild. Below them, so was the sporting director, Monchi, beating at his chest and blowing kisses, getting into another confrontation when he finally made way, Sergio Canales among those having a few choice words. Down in the tunnel, the referee’s report said, there was an “altercation”: when he had come out to see what was going on, though, they all scarpered like schoolkids the moment teacher turns up. “We weren’t able to identify any of them,” he wrote. “When you celebrate a draw, there’s nothing more to say,” Betis midfielder Guido Rodríguez claimed, but there’s always something to say. “Well, this is a derby,” said González as Gudelj paced about behind him.","charCount":"8376","shouldHideReaderRevenue":"false","showAffiliateLinks":"false","bylineHtml":"<a href=\"profile/sidlowe\">Sid Lowe</a>"},"isHosted":false,"pillarId":"pillar/sport","pillarName":"Sport"},{"id":"world/2022/nov/07/row-brews-in-iran-over-use-of-its-drones-in-ukraine-war-by-russia","type":"article","sectionId":"world","sectionName":"World news","webPublicationDate":"2022-11-07T14:11:41Z","webTitle":"Row brews in Iran over use of its drones in Ukraine war by Russia","webUrl":"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/07/row-brews-in-iran-over-use-of-its-drones-in-ukraine-war-by-russia","apiUrl":"https://content.guardianapis.com/world/2022/nov/07/row-brews-in-iran-over-use-of-its-drones-in-ukraine-war-by-russia","fields":{"headline":"Row brews in Iran over use of its drones in Ukraine war by Russia","standfirst":"<p>Conservative cleric and a newspaper editor openly critical of government’s stance on weapons it supplied to Moscow</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2022/nov/07/russia-ukraine-war-live-news-zelenskiy-warns-of-mass-attacks-on-power-grid-kyiv-mayor-raises-prospect-of-evacuations\">Russia-Ukraine war – latest news updates</a></li></ul>","trailText":"Conservative cleric and a newspaper editor openly critical of government’s stance on weapons it supplied to Moscow","byline":"Patrick Wintour, Diplomatic editor","main":"<figure class=\"element element-image\" data-media-id=\"0eea8ec2dc67057a5e05fcf2f8829abb54204717\"> <img src=\"https://media.guim.co.uk/0eea8ec2dc67057a5e05fcf2f8829abb54204717/0_105_1255_753/1000.jpg\" alt=\"Two police officers in Kyiv shoot into the air\" width=\"1000\" height=\"600\" class=\"gu-image\" /> <figcaption> <span class=\"element-image__caption\">Police officers in Kyiv, Ukraine, last month shoot at what was believed to be one of a number of Iranian-supplied Shahed-136 drones during a Russian strike.</span> <span class=\"element-image__credit\">Photograph: Reuters</span> </figcaption> </figure>","body":"<p>An internal rift over the supply of deadly drones to Russia for use in Ukraine has opened up in Iran, with a prominent conservative cleric and newspaper editor saying Russia is the clear aggressor in the war and the supply should stop.</p> <p>A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military.</p> <p>Iran has denied for more than two months that it sold the drones to Russia despite their use to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/oct/17/kyiv-hit-by-a-series-of-explosions-from-drone-attack\">target power stations and civilian infrastructure</a>, but at the weekend <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/nov/05/iran-says-it-supplied-drones-to-russia-before-ukraine-war-began\">said it had supplied a small number of drones before the war started</a>, an explanation that has been rejected by the US and Ukraine.</p> <p>The row over the drones reflects a wider foreign policy debate in Tehran about the risks of developing close links with Moscow.

A former Iranian ambassador to Moscow has also hinted the foreign ministry may have been kept in the dark both by the Kremlin and the Iranian military. Iran has denied for more than two months that it sold the drones to Russia despite their use to target power stations and civilian infrastructure, but at the weekend said it had supplied a small number of drones before the war started, an explanation that has been rejected by the US and Ukraine.
