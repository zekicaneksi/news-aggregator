# news-aggregator

Hello!

This is my News Aggregator app that I built using Laravel (PHP) and Next.js (React).


Some features;

- Using API's, periodically the news database is updated.
- Users can authenticate and save their favorite authors, sources and categories and have a personalized feed.
- News are filterable by category, source, keyword and date.
- The site is mobile responsive.
